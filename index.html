              Hi there stranger!
            </h1>
            <p>Stay a while, and listen üë¥üèª...</p>
            <p>
              Once upon a time, the universe was born and stars exploded generating trillions and
              trillions of atoms of heavy metals that somehow ended up on a planet named Earth.
              These metals then, along with complex carbon molecules, after billions of years
              composed this biological being, the most advanced creature to ever walk on the planet.
              That then ended up sitting in a weird, sloped position behind a computer screen
              writing long days and evenings inanimate abstract hieroglyphs named programming code.
              That produced this delirious website filled with mundane knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, I'm not <i>complaining</i>. I'll take this lethargic lobotomizing of senses
              over mucking around farming a field in Middle-Age society. In context of things, you
              could say this is rather pleasant even.
            </p>

              So as part of my epic quest through the perils of life I've crafted this tedious
              patch of virtual land in the open sea of internet. To me, personal home pages should
              be created with humor and joy and a little bit of madness as I recall them from the days of
              yonder. Sure, 90's websites may not tick all the boxes of modern UX design but god
              damn they had something real and honest about them. Nowadays it seems the most
              important job of your home site is to promote SEO-optimized low-level programming
              tutorials to boost your visibility and provide you the x of what such fame brings.
              Such a foolish quest, where's the humanity? Where's the person behind the screen?
              Commodized and calculated we have come, futilely optimizing our lives to be a second
              page result in how to setup a React app with TypeScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Right right, I am getting off-tangent here. Bout of insanity, happens a lot when
              writing your blog. Did you know this is the <strong>third</strong> iteration of
              this site with virtually the same UI? Wait what why - you ask. And I whisper in your
              ear: "because I can". And because Gatsby, obviously, is way too bloated and Next.js
              just annoys me with its overly strict conventions. Boohoo, css files are not
              referenced in app.tsx or don't have .module.css suffix. Who cares. Also, I've found out
              the hard way how crucial low-maintenance is for a site supposed to last for decades.
              Now that I've written this using a custom Vite renderer plugin (yes, I could have probably
              invented a cure for cancer if I had spent the time on that instead) I think I've finally reached apotheosis of my blog.
              Well, a few things could be enhanced, sure, but <i>maybe</i> this time I'll
              focus on other things instead. Sometimes the goal <i>is</i> more important than the
              journey...
            </p>
            <p>So *cough cough* <i>what I am saying</i> is,</p>
