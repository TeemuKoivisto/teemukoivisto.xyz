  <b>Welcome!</b> I'm <b>Teemu Koivisto</b> and this my little blog.
</p>

<p>
  So uhh... What about me then. Okay. Well. As a short introduction I'm a programmer, as you might
  have noticed.
</p>

<p>I mostly work with web development, such as NodeJS and TypeScript.</p>

<style lang="scss">
  p {
    @apply my-8;
  }
</style>
