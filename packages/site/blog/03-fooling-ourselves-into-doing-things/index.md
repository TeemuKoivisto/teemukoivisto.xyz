# Introduction

We all want to achieve something in life. Or at least you'd hope.

To pursue this great big task, there are many intermediate tasks on the way that seem to be always on our path — _if only I did **this** one thing it will change everything._. Well anyway. It's somewhat ridiculous to believe we somehow achieve all of these things by our own work alone _yet_ there are ways to at least put ourselves in the _right_ state of mind to pursue them.

What do I mean? Well, I've long thought that we humans behave on _loops._ Very similar to how robots behave with **control-loops** yet since we are smarter ours are more indeterminate. Right?

Which is true yet I've noticed myself getting carried away by these sudden inspirations that have seemingly come out of nowhere but which certainly _have_ come out of somewhere. For example, an inspiration to practise music — I heard some live music or found a new artist. Or read an article about 10 best songwriting tricks. For programming: I might have seen a cool GitHub project or a blog post about something that has put my brains in motion. And so on.

There are constant forces around us that bombard us with their input to which, in turn, we react to. I've noticed that once this input reaches a certain threshold I start spiraling into the subject deeper and deeper until finally I have to go to sleep or do something else. Eventually, I might lose that initial spark of inspiration and whatever it was I was really into starts to slip away from me as another thing comes to dominate my thoughts.

But certainly this isn't an absolute truth. We go to work not because we suddenly get inspired by some LinkedIn post every morning but because we have to. However, at one point I am sure you had the moment of inspiration to pursue your profession and later on — through consuming of related content or just applying for a school — you were drowned into the loop of achieving your goal of employment.

Well, you probably can see where I am going with this. So you saw a TikTok video of some douche making a buck producing the most basic content and thought "I can do this". Or you've long held a secret dream of publishing your first book. Or whatever — coding your own app.

To bring that thing into reality you need:

- A) persistence
- B) time
- C) motivation and
- D) (optional) talent

I think overemphasizing talent has been blown out of proportion and with regular keen mind you can get pretty far to a level of satisfactory mediocrity.

Now, however, you have to construct your plan. The How.

I'm not going to suggest anything here — you probably know a lot better than me. **But.** I bet this involves in producing a constant loop or sorts. Calling out a buddy who shares similar interests to work on something together. Or going to a class, to a school. We humans are very much attuned to our surroundings and being surrounded by like-minded and motivated people will steer us very sternly towards that shared goal.

Not news to anyone (I hope) yet I can not emphasize enough the value of these social settings and routine structures. Especially in the beginning when the cognitive burden is too much for our unaccustomed brains to handle, that we **need** a way to decompress and push through the initial inertia. For myself, I see as the turning point of any hobby or interest the moment when I'm able to come up with my own version of doing things without outside help. And internalize my vision so deeply that I no longer need to be constantly reminded by my teacher to practise before lessons — I will do it on my own already.

## qwer

Now, for the less fortunate people who have interests that aren't shared by that many or is just hard to socialize with (or you just don't want to), things get a little more complicated. This is also where I struggle when there is no direct social support. Side-projects after work with no enforced deadlines or goals. Writing something very niche who no one I know wants (probably) to read.

I have been blessed with reasonably good persistence (sisu perkele) and stamina, so I do pull things off over the long-term if I am motivated enough. But that might take a while. And also during the process I might get frustrated and figure out something better to do.

So how do you avoid that? Here's my collection of the best tricks I've found:

### Just doing it

You just empty your mind and start hitting the buttons. Block out all the rest and let your subconscious lizard brain take over. The important part is _deciding to do it_ and committing fully. Similar to how you might lift heavy weights in the gym — once you pull that bar from the rack and it's hanging over your head, you better not half-ass it with your left eye scanning a Twitch stream at the same time.

But as your body then embraces this sudden stimulus, soon the external distractions and discomfort fade away (over months of practise at least), and you find yourself getting into the flow. Maybe an analogue could be your brain is buffering the situation and evicting the useless chatter and doubt in return.

In my opinion, this is the best trick which always works if you truly decide to do it. It's just building up the urgency and motivation is somewhat linked to it, as otherwise it can feel like self-torture which could burn you out. Letting your brains go free is important part of life as well, so perhaps a good balance could be to schedule these "forced doing outs" beforehand. So your mind wouldn't always have to evaluate whether this would be a good time to "decide doing things."

### Preparing/that word yourself for action

But if you have really fallen out of your routines and are just spiraling wildly, it may be wise to xxx yourself for small but frequent wins. This is bit hard to define exactly, but if you imagine your brains as this sloshing bucket of water, it _could_ be a good idea to steady it first before trying to pour something out of it.

I believe the best practical way of stabilizing your brain is by physical movement or exercise. If your brains are fried already, no amount of abstract thinking in my mind helps with recalibrating yourself with the material world. Actually being present and not wandering around, I think your body and mind needs real xx stimulus to stir it awake again.

In a way I see it a little like programming your brain. You give it orders: go and put that x into garbage bin. Move those papers from the desk. Put the things in their right place. And then you execute those tasks. With zero fuss, no second thoughts. Let the cognitive drain of "working" slowly vanish and become a little like a robot. Just doing things.

I myself do this sometimes, although this kinda requires the same amount of "deciding" as the previous method. You have to blank your mind and forget your resistance to energy expenditure. I suppose the difference is that you do small physical tasks instead of abstract, very focus-intensive things.

One thing I like to do (at times) during the work day, is squat jumps and push ups. If I feel really groggy, just slowly going from standing up to squatting is also helpful as warm-up. For that extra glutes activation, I try to keep my elbows in front of me and hit my knees when I go down. Then, I do as many push ups with a small break and 2-3 sets total for about 4 minutes.

It's miniscule time to spend but the effects are immense. Trying to work when you feel sluggish and tired is just fool's errand and I find the ability to do this little work out as the biggest indicator how sharp I am. If it feels like an unsurmountable task to do a couple squat jumps, I know my physical state is just not ready for any focusing task. But if you can do the uncomfortable little exercise, your mind starts to get clearer. It doesn't always lead to a state where working would feel easy, but it helps easing off the initial inertia.

### Eliminating distractions

As the jump from complete indolence to total commitment is a tad hard to _decide_, I find it much easier when I steer myself first from the useless activities and slowly let my subconscious pick up the clues that I should do _something_ probably right now.

This includes blocking Youtube which, if I need to really watch a video, involves some resistance as I have to change it from the settings each time to do.

For writing I've noticed that with computer it's too easy for me to get side-tracked. Just the need for little research here and there turns into a binge of Wikipedia with my focus totally gone. Also the easiness of editing makes it harder for me to just _write._

Instead, I've found writing long-hand suits me a lot better. Just scribbling to a notebook in evenings and I feel no pressure of over-editing or researching and it allows me to completely focus on writing. Also helps with reduced screentime.

### Easing into it

This is perhaps the method I was first inspired to write this article about. Sometimes just eliminating distractions and deciding isn't enough to make you feel like you want to do something. In that case, I recommend a sprinkle of inspiration.

Here I'd allow myself to watch a few videos or read some articles in a related subject which I'd wish to perform. Analyses of songs for music. Programming rage-bait or start-up success stories for coding. Writers talking about their craft or book reviews. Introduction videos — whatever.

The point is you attempt to reproduce a positive atmosphere relating to that thing you want to do and then — seemingly like out of nowhere — you find yourself wanting to do just a little bit. Juuuust a little to see whether your material is any good compared to that what you just saw.

Or, you get completely side-tracked and end up wasting your time.

In those cases, it might be better to just hit a reset button and let your brain run on idle gear. You'll eventually hit some ground (I hope), to rebounce back to where you want to be headed at. Hey, that rhymed.

In larger context it's always important to see the bigger picture and it might be, that your brain is signaling that instead of grinding on yet anotehr side-project you should focus on some more concrete realities. I recommend hanging around people in those cases and just talking bullshit. It might help to see what's the problem.

And sometimes when you feel really uninspired and there's no pressing deadline to meet — congratulate yourself! You've succeeded in managing your most pressing topics and now you can take it easy for a while. Work at your own leisurely pace or do whatever. Don't let the nagging feeling of accomplishing something to rob you of this wonderful moment of absolute freedom in deciding what to do.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are many ways to bamboozle yourself but sometimes you are being bamboozled by bamboozling. Then just chill and try to enjoy things.
