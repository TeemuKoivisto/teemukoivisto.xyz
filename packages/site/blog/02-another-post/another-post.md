It must somehow be in our blood. By us, I mean anyone who has ventured into programming for any
extend periods of time. The fact that we can seemingly create _anything_ if we just set our minds
into it is at the same time exhilariting yet daunting. Of the million opportunities in front of us,
which one we should choose?

To get into the meat of the issue, I want to talk about **over-engineering**. That perilous yet, somehow,
exciting hobby that we tend to drift into too often than I'd for sure like. How come!? Shouldn't it
be easy to decide once and for all that _this_ tool is what I'm going to use - regardless what others say -
and just make this _one_ thing.

Cut to: 3 months later you have abandoned your original project and are consumed by a side-project B of the
said project A which should make creating the project A much smoother. **AND** were you to make projects
C and D, the project B would surely be an immense help. And also, it could generate you some visibility
with GitHub stars and whatnot - possibilities are endless! Because the way A is done currently is crap and
therefore, to be a good OSS advocate, _you_ have decided to change the status quo and make a lasting impact
on this xx world.

I'd wager that most of software engineers have veered into this kind of situation. And, having burnt out after
6 months without getting neither A or B done, we ask ourselves - why? Why do I this to myself? Am I just so
**stupid** that I can't just organize my thoughts and willpower to do just a simple thing on my own.

It's quite demoralizing really. To understand that even with your wizard-like skills, you are merely an ape
pressing buttons and as easy to distract as a cat with xx tied to an end of stick. Somehow, the rigor how you
have done your work and in general, set yourself to do simple tasks just does not translate into long-term
projects and facing the ever-growing vortex of infinite possibilities.
