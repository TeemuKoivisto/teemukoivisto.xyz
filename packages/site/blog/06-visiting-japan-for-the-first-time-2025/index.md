# Introduction

The wonderful, the weird and the mysteriously unique Japan. I suppose everyone in any Western country grows up with an idealized version of what Japan is through interacting with its culture and products. Something very familiar, like the comfy ride of a Corolla. Yet something completely unknown, as demonstrated by the confusingly complicated relationships of any anime characters amongst each other. So modern yet so ancient. Like a horse-buggy with AC and full audio-system. You can't really define it yet you know there's internal juxtaposition.

Well, so me and my friends have talked about visiting Japan for a _long time._ Maybe ehh too long, at least considering one of my friend's last visit vas 2008. And he's been going off ever since how great it is.

But so, finally the stars aligned and the obstacles of finding a moderately priced airplane tickets as well as availability of all members came to be.

I can't remember how many we had talked about visiting Japan together together as a group of friends, until the stars were finally _right_.

Japan, that wonderfully mysterious country where, despite of its population, things just worked yet as a whole,
was still trapped in its old, perhaps archaic, bubble. It's hard to list all of the many wonders of Japan to someone who hasn't been intrigued by at some point in their lives since it sounds, on paper, rather plain. Excellent food, weird culture, polite people, low cost of living, remarkable public transportation, beautiful nature and so on. Nothing of these in themselves are a cause to visit a country, a rather distant for many in that, but the collective xxx amalgation of them combined really can make you feel **alive** again.

So our expectations were high. Perhaps because one of our friends had often advertised Japan as the "best" country he has ever visited or because we all liked the general vibe of Japan. Convenient yet weird—how awesome!

## The setup

Depending on your style of travel, you possible are either a Samsonite traveler with a sturdy travel suitcase or a more rambunctious backpacker with a fancy Fjällräven. I lean towards backpacks due to their versatility and I don't like carrying a heavy bag on my back. However, when the situation so arises that my vacation place is highly modern and allows easy rolling of your luggage I must say, suitcase does beat backpack. Such as Japan.

I suppose there's a third type who use backpacks that have wheels, such as one my friends and who I inquired about where to buy such fancy things. But it's the rather xxx simplicity of a backbag and its more reliable defence against stars and other inconvenient obstacles, that I—alongisde my friends—readied my old backpack for the trip.

And mine actually is quite low-level. 50€ from Amazon for our 2019 India-Nepal trip, it already had broken one strap which I had repaired as well as the clamps to carabiners. Carrying with me I took:

- 4 sets of socks, underwear, t-shirts
- sweatpants, windjacket, finer blouse, hoodie, swim shorts, towel, running shoes, slippers
- hygiene gear, razor, ear plugs, suncream, hand sanitizer, sunglasses
- laptop, camera, universal adapter
- notebooks, mechanical pencil, book by Ray Bradbury, dice, playing cards
- passport neck bag, coin holder, foldable shoulder bag

divided into my big backback and smaller bag for carry-on luggage, in addition to the clothes I had on me (extra sock-underwear-tshirt set, jeans and leather jacket (it was cold in Finland)).

Now, glancing through the list you might have different preferences on the clothes or whatever extra gadgets you like. But I'd say it's a pretty good list for a normal male, intending to stay at hotels and travel light for 6 weeks. Although I must admit, in hindsight, that it has some glaring deficiencies. Mainly, I forgot my wireless earbuds as well as ... and cover bag for the laptop (my small backpack had no laptop pocket). Also, I should have took only jacket and bore the chill with hoodie underneath as well as just running shoes. Having options is nice, but when a jacket becomes just deadweight or running shoes are just superior for walking every day, you feel you've done something wrong.
