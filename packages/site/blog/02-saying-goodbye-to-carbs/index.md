# Introduction

I, as many others, have desired to improve my health and well-being by exercising and reducing my body fat percentage. This has involved various tricks over the years mostly around my diet and training regimen. Yes yes, here I add the mandatory disclaimer that reducing your body fat isn't always necessary.

The problem and its solution in itself are quite simple: you have excess calorie intake and therefore you must decrease it until you've reached a body fat percentage you feel satisfied with. What makes it difficult though is the very complicated relationship we humans have with our bodies and our **food**.

See, we are not logical beings in most circumstances. We follow our insticts which, majority of time, seem to serve us pretty good. However, while we'd wish to eat less it might be that we find ourselves in situations where the unwanted option — unnecessary calories — is just too tempting to refuse. A late evening walk to a store, picking food on the go, social events — the list goes on. To choose simply to _eat less_ is hardly an easy task.

# Ketogenic diet

And as many have found out, reducing calories is quite over-simplistic solution to weight loss in long-term. An easier way for me and many others, has been using a restricted diet which specifically eliminates any ambiguity from eating food that's not nutrious or filling.

A huge hit and source of controversy has been the so-called **ketogenic diet**. Ketogenic diet [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet) works on the metabolic state called _ketosis_ in which your body switches its primary energy source from glucose (sugar) to ketones (fat).

> “When glycogen and blood glucose reserves are low, a metabolic shift occurs in order to save glucose for the brain which is unable to use fatty acids for energy. This shift involves increasing fatty acid oxidation and production of ketones in the liver as an alternate energy source for the brain as well as the skeletal muscles, heart, and kidney.”

> — <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis#Causes">Wikipedia</a></cite>

From my experience, this occurs after eating less than 20 grams of carbs per day for half a week after which it sustains itself pretty well. Even with an occasional +20 gram carb intake. It also causes a variety of other side-effects such your blood sugar stabilizing more evenly throughout the day. With carbs I've noticed big swings after I eat a heavy lunch and my brains are simply unable focus well anymore. There's a certain sense of lightness and clarity, I'd say, with ketosis where even a slight sensation of hunger doesn't affect me that much.

And for dieting it's perfect! As you are already in the fat burning state the transition between burning calories from your food to burning fat from your body is much quicker. Your gut bacteria also starts to adapt to your new food supply, quite soon eliminating your cravings for any sugar which helps a lot with breaking the diet. You are perhaps socially impaired, of course, and when others are enjoying their pizzas you'll have to do with a salad and drink diet soda at the bar. But the trade-off I say is worth it.

Food-wise, the holy trinity for ketogenic food for me has become the combination of lean meat, cheese and frozen vegetables with some olive oil. Fried in the pan or cooked in the oven — doesn't matter. It tastes just as good. Add in a meat cube and you got yourself very healthy and very sating (and very cheap) food which easily amounts to 20g of carbs per day (100 grams of veggies is like 7 grams). The fibers of the vegetables fill you up while the fat and protein provide you with stable energy throughout the day.

I also have a hypothesis that once you enter the fat-burning state you receive stronger signals from your body of sated energy needs. With carbs this can be mollified and if you by chance over-eat you enter a completely different state I call "hibernation gorging". I'm not sure what kind of apocalyptical event my body thinks it wants to prepare for but it's seemingly insatiable in its consumption of carbs.

# My recent keto-diet

I recently (January 2024) did a very intense 3-week ketogenic diet where I rapidly lost 5 kgs. This involved in addition to the cuisine I just mentioned both resistance exercises in the gym as well as 8km late evening runs when I'd feel a tinge of hunger. Yes, pretty intense. But to me it's easier when the progress is fast so the duration is shorter, even if it is more demanding. And sure, after the diet ended I quickly bounced back 2 kgs as my body rebuilt the glycose reserves eventually stabilizing to around 2 kg weight loss.

But it did work! Once I entered ketosis being hungry didn't feel bad at all. Also, in the evenings as I _did_ feel like eating, after I went for a run after 8 PM my hunger was completely gone. I assume this was my body jumping from signaling "plz feed me" to "okay, we are in danger — let's use stores now" in rapid fashion.

Once the diet was in full swing one side-effect I noticed when I pushed myself with these late evening runs was that I started to wake up very early without an alarm clock, all alert. I jokingly refer to the state as "Super Saiyan" mode since I believe it's some kind of genetic survival response which we probably acquired as we roamed the savannah. Rather awkward when you don't get enough sleep but still wake up — you'll be tired and out of focus the whole day.

Well anyway. After 3 weeks I reached my target weight and alas, succumbed to the carnal desires of pizza and pasta. Interestingly, I did not crave sugar in the slightest although I did eat some and thought "meh" about it. But then, as I was munging on some pesto pasta, I felt the old temptation to eat just a _little bit_ more once again. The same temptation that told me I could buy just _one_ frozen pizza for easy late lunch.

This made me realize that my state was not in equilibrium.

# The Epiphany

I understood that I was simply deceiving myself were I to continue doing the same old thing as before. I had tried it — saying no to unnecessary calories. But time after time — somehow — I'd get a little soft and buy something easy and whops. I'd go over what I expend that day and slowly but surely, accrue unspent energy until I'd be at the state before the diet. In order to _stay_ where I was, I'd have to change something permanently. I'd have to make ketogenic food my **standard** food.

Okay, it sounds a little more dramatic than what I actually mean. So normally I'd eat (if I cook at home) some pesto pasta or meat with rice or potatoes — pretty basic stuff. However, as I'd eat these carbs I'd be also more inclined to eat more in one go or buy something less fulfilling at the store — pizza or bread or whatnot. Luckily I grew past my ice cream frenzy age last fall as I used to eat them as a snack on a regular basis after exercise 😶. Nowadays, the only sweet stuff I consume is diet soda (but not Coke or Pepsi as I can't tolerate them anymore) that, even with its faults, is healthier than for example ice cream. And fruits.

<!-- toistoa -->

But as I would eat like this — normally — inevitably a special occurence would occur (or just a lapse of judgement) when I would over-eat beyond what I could burn. And if my regular intake would be around my nominal consumption, by simple math it's easy to see that over time this surplus would eventually lead me back to where I was before I lost weight.

Therefore, it would seem that the only way to actually solve this would be to stay in perpetual slight negative surplus. Not much, but just enough to offset the occasional gatherings and cravings which cause me to gain weight the most. I still very much want to enjoy eating sweets and whatever carbs I wish in the future **but.** I have trade something away if I want to stay at my weight and do that.

What does this mean then in practise? Well, I will become that weirdo who will bring most of the time their own food to office. I will miss out eating out with co-workers or whoever on occasion — or just end up drinking coffee together. But I honestly feel now that it would be just delusion if I pretended that I could control my eating with only the "don't eat too much" rule to abide by.

It's somewhat bitter-sweet realization that I can't control myself well enough and have to take up these measures. Smart enough for self-realization but then dumb enough to keep falling for it. So that I have to restrict myself to veggies and meat and cheese for all eternity as my standard food. Strange to think about it. Is this how people feel when they give up on meat products or other major food products? Not that my decision is as strict but still, the clairvoyance hurts a bit.

# April update

Since I first started writing this in February, I have put this theory into practise. At the moment, it seems the cycle goes now a week or two at a time of keto-food only until I have one of those special circumstances and I want to enjoy food and drink in a group. This carb-consumption goes on for a while, a week or so, and my weight slightly increases as I "catch-up" on my cravings.

Then, once I have gotten the cravings out of my system, I almost start to miss the nutrious and sating veggies, meat and fat. And while my brain still goes on to wanting carbs, once I eat my first keto lunch I already am too invested in it to not break it for some unneeded carbs. At the moment I weight slightly less than after the 3 week intense diet, 1 kg or so. And from what my weight tracking app can tell me the projection is downwards if I keep going.

But the biggest thing I have found is that **this is doable.** I don't really find myself missing carbs in my daily food. Sure, I miss eating pizza and how easy it's to have a go-to snack from store when you are in rush. But overall I am **happy** with what I eat. I have successfully jedi mind-tricked myself to lower my expectations and now one banana I eat feels as nice as the sugary ice cream cone from the store.

I might update this in the years to come whether things change.

# Conclusion

These has been my subjective observations on my eating habits. They may not apply to you but _if_ you feel like you're overeating on regular basis I suggest trying out a ketogenic diet for say two weeks. You'll figure out so much about your preconceived notions that you _need_ carbs while in fact, eating veggies and some meat and oil is actually (at least to me) more filling. Of course, this is not medical advice and your doctor probably knows the best if your body can handle it.

And on long-term, I advice you to pay close attention on the fat and protein you consume since they don't scare you of the saturated fat for no reason. I personally noticed that, when I first did keto-diet, and really wanted ice cream I made it from heavy cream and sweetener. Which was good but having eaten it for two weeks regularly, I started noticing slight heaviness in my chest. So uhh. Don't do it. And go to medical check-ups.

Dieting in itself is a practised skill just like any another and I feel I have gotten better at it the more I have done it. If you have never tried it — keto or otherwise — seriouly don't expect to achieve everything in your first attempt.

As a final side-note, I also have a genetic deficiency that causes infamous keto-rash from the aceton my body breaks down from fats. It's itchy (and ugly) but it's tolerable if I'm not too heavy into ketosis for extended periods of time. Which kinda puts a lid on how much keto-dieting I can even do on one go hence the rapid 3 weeks.
