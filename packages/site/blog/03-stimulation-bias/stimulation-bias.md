Humans are apes. Homo homo sapiens is our latin description according to Wikipedia [1] and as such, we have biological habits that are hard to shake no matter what.

If you put xx apes in a cage you believe they won't sit still. Probably they will start misbehaving and xxx. Some apes must of course enjoy the stillness and just lay down. However, by mere choice they would probably gather and commence on something exciting.

According to a much cited research on mice, when left on their own with nothing to do, they will be more likely to resort to drugs, indicating that we, animals, _need_ routinely stimulation. 

So, does it come to no wonder that we, humans, are no different?

Recall the days when sitting on a boring class you started to xx your chair and scribble some xx on your vihko? I'd argue this falls into same category.



Now I am going to make a leap of faith and propose that these laws of nature occur in work place as well. Not just in the ordinary sense - everyone would hate to do same mundane task everyday unless there was some payoff (such as doing it so fast you can take a long break) - no news here. But. There are also much more hidden xx behaviornal pitfalls that we humans fall into. 

Have you, in your work, spent absurdly long periods of time optimizing things with perhaps indistinguishable benefits to overall output? And, if you have, can you reason exactly what drove you to do it? In plain terms. It's basically work you were doing, however, you did it for a much more intensive xxx than it required. Why would you?

I assume your answer is going to be simply: because you enjoyed it. You enjoyed optimizing a ridiculously convoluted xxx from 3 rows to 2? Objectively, that sounds mad. Doing xx work that basically has little benefit and overall affects your career prospects it would be obvious for you to not to do it. I'm sure you'd tell your manager the exact same thing: "it wasn't urgent but we needed to xx our techinical debt". We've heard that story.

Having programmed now for quite a while and observed this phenomenon happen by me and others, I'd categorize this as "stimulation deficit". Some call it overengineering, some with other names. In general it's agreed it is detrimental yet we seem to be quite blind to it, at least as we start. Later, of course, we start to detect our own xxx patterns that don't contribute that well to our xxx and restrain ourselves from doing them. 

However, I do think it's good to acknowledge this as decipher it's cause and treatment. 

buu baa bii boo

Following this logic, I make another hypothesis. Our stimulation baseline maps to what we find most interesting. The habitual over-engineer might not just function well in an environment where detailed work is not in high demand and perhaps even frowned upon. Instead of just concluding that the person is a hopeless tinkerer, it's better to find them a tool that perhaps helps them to achieve a constant stimulation.

Many wonder why on earth would someone in their right mind spend time on learning some difficult and rather xxx situational language such as Haskell or Rust when you could, technically, arrive at similarly performing solution with something easier, such as Java or JS/TS. Are those people just hopelessly insane?

Probably :D. Well, of course not. Yet instead of labeling them as silly over-engineering fanatics, I think we should instead label them as people who need much higher stimulus from programming than the general populace. Not as a ego-boosting attribute of somekind of superior mental capacity but as a need for certain level of play and variation that might not be possible with a simpler language. Instead of hacking together another sloppy prototype they rather would spend the week programming something obscure and tedious which would not sit well on many occasion.

I long believed myself to be a somewhat go-getter, and still do, but I've found there's a certain level of rigidness and clenliness that I gravitate towards to, no matter what. An irritatingly broken app to me is an abomination that should be fixed immediately before anything new should be done. I can begrudingly do it for a limited period of time, but ultimately I will succumb to generalizing the interfaces. Fixing the types. Adding tests.

Also it could be a need to cognitively accustom to the programming culture of the project the need to try things and fail a couple times before accepting the status quo. It's very context-dependent. Idk man.

All in all, pop a message in the comments or whatever to let me know if I'm crazy or does this make sense.
