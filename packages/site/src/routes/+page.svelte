  <h3 class="mt-12 mb-8 font-sans text-2xl">Epilogue</h3>

  <p>
    Once upon a time, the universe was born filled with trillions and trillions of stars. These
    stars exploded, generating all the heavier metals of the universe of which a miniscule portion
    ended up on a planet named Earth. These metals in the primordial goo of Earth, combined with
    complex carbon molecules reacted in the most miraculous way, creating life. After billions of
    years, this progress finally reached its pinnacle by creating humans - the most advanced
    creature ever to walk the planet. That ended up sitting in a weird, sloped position behind a
    computer screen writing long hours of inanimate abstract hieroglyphs named programming code,
    producing this delirious website filled with mundane knowledge.

    Had I been born couple hundreds years prior, instead of this website you'd have probably
    encountered instead a rambling maniac in a tavern. Shouting over the other drunken noise about
    how to seed your fields with less manure. So you win some, lose some.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyway uhh. About my blog then. Well. As part of my epic quest through the perils of life I've
    come to desire my own little virtual plot of land. As a mere snot-nosed child, I recall the
    quirky buzzing of the modem haggardly pulling the strands of the World Wide Web 56 kilobytes at
    a time. Oh those wondrous days of yonder! The weird pages with blinking texts and marquees,
    where an opionated nutcase would share their vision of society.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sure, 90's web wasn't known for its aestheticness nor intuitiveness but there was something real
    and honest about it. Nowadays, the most important thing of a home page is to boost your job
    prospects and to give your name stupid SEO visibility. But I beseech you, what's the point? Does
    it really enhance your life to be the second page result in tutorials how to setup a React app
    with TypeScript?

  <h3 class="mt-12 mb-8 font-sans text-2xl">Moving on</h3>

  <p>
    Okay, help the old man off the soapbox. Bout of insanity, happens a lot when making your blog. A
    fun fact, this is the third iteration of this site. Third. "What, why?" - you ask. And I whisper
    in your ear: "Because I can".
  </p>

  <p>
    But to be frank, Gatsby is quite annoying with its bloated configs and NextJS, while cool and
    fast, is just too corporate and soulless to inspire my creativity. Why waste your precious life
    building a blog if it feels like a chore? Well, you do take out the trash even if you don't feel
    like it so I guess my point is, sometimes it's more fun to do learn stuff than to finish them.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Svelte and SvelteKit, oh boy. That's my <i>jam</i> right there! Feels so light and unabstracted.
    No fascist linter to break my build because I forgot to indent correctly. I dare to say, almost fun
    even.
  </p>

  <p>
    And I did go off to crazy end as well and tried to use vanilla JS with WebComponents with my own
    vite plugin to render static HTML pages. Let's just say that there is pain and then there is
    sticking your hand into a nest of bullet ants pain. Like Rich Harris explained in a blog post,
    they just aren't there yet and you need at least templating and easy if-else to withold any remnants
    of sanity.

  <p>So what the hell was I supposed to even write about now...</p>

  <h3 class="mt-12 mb-8 font-sans text-2xl">In conclusion</h3>

  <p>
    I like music, I like writing. I like going to gym while listening to Brothers of Karamazov and
    not understanding anything. Sometimes I code something worth publishing which you can find on
    GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/TeemuKoivisto/teemukoivisto.xyz"
      >like this blog for example!</a
