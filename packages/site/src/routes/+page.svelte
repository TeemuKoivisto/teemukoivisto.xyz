    <b>Welcome!</b> I'm <b>Teemu Koivisto</b> and this my little blog.
  </p>

  <h3>Epilogue</h3>

  <p>
    Once upon a time, the universe was born filled with trillions and trillions of star. These stars
    exploded, generating all the heavier metals of the universe of which a miniscule portion ended
    up on a planet named Earth. These metals combined with complex carbon molecules started to react
    in the most miraculous way creating life which after billions of years of evolution, created
    humans - the most advanced creature ever to walk the planet. Which then ended up sitting in a
    weird, sloped position behind a computer screen writing long hours of inanimate abstract
    hieroglyphs named programming code. That produced this delirious website filled with mundane
    knowledge.
  </p>

  <p>
    Had I been born couple hundreds years prior though, I'd probably be just a rambling maniac in a
    tavern shouting over the other drunken noise about how to seed your fields with less manure. So
    you win some, lose some.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyway uhh. About my blog then. Well. As part of my epic quest through the perils of life I've
    come to desire my own little virtual plot of land. As I was a mere snot-nosed child, I remember
    hearing the quirky sound of the modem and my first encounter with the World Wide Web. The weird
    web pages of crazy blinking text where some very opionated nutcase shared their vision of
    society. Sure, 90's web wasn't known for its aestheticness nor intuitiveness but there was
    something real and honest about it too. Nowadays, the most important thing of a home page is to
    boost your job prospects and to give your name stupid SEO visibility. But I beseech you, what's
    the point? Does it really enhance your life to be the second page result in tutorials how to
    setup a React app with TypeScript?

    Okay, help the old man off the soapbox. Bout of insanity, happens a lot when making your blog. A
    fun fact, this is the third iteration of this site. Third. What, why - you ask. And I whisper in
    your ear: "because I can".
  </p>

  <p>
    But to be frank, Gatsby is quite annoying with its bloated configs and NextJS, while cool and
    fast, is just too corporate and soulless to inspire my creativity. Why waste your precious life
    building a blog if it feels like a chore? Well, you do take out the trash even if you don't feel
    like it so I guess my point is, sometimes it's more fun to do learn stuff than to finish them.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Svelte and SvelteKit, oh boy. That's my <i>jam</i> right there! Feels so light and unabstracted.
    No fascist linter to break my build because I forgot to indent correctly. I dare to say, almost fun
    even.
  </p>

  <p>
    And I did go off to crazy end as well and tried to use vanilla JS with WebComponents with my own
    vite plugin to render static HTML pages. Let's just say that there is pain and then there is
    sticking your hand into a nest of bullet ants pain. Like Rich Harris explained in a blog post,
    they just aren't there yet and you need at least templating and easy if-else to withold any xx
    of sanity.
  </p>

  <p>ü§î What the hell was I supposed to say now.</p>

  <p>
    I like music, I like writing. I like going to gym while listening to Brothers of Karamazov and
    not understanding anything. Sometimes I code something worth publishing which you can find on
    GitHub, like this blog for example!
