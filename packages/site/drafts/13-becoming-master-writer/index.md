# Introduction

After years of torturing my brains with the most tedious JavaScript dependency errors, CSS layout bugs and even some Rust borrow checker problems, I've reached a point where I can start a coding project and just "do it." By doing it, I mean I have become so practised in hacking away code that I impetiously just start writing without thinking about too much. This goes here and that goes there. Only when I reach unknown new paths I've never seen before, I might have to stop to think. However, even then I have developed an instinct to pick the one that seems the most suitable and not worry too much about the details of it. Most of the time.

The way I've reached this point is mostly through work and building my own projects. With work you most likely always want to be fast (to show you're doing stuff) but at times things can become a little mellow. With my own projects, however, I have noticed becoming increasingly impatient in building them. I think I've finally got the "cute programming" out of my system and just want to see something actual tangible ASAP. With style, of course. I hold myself to that much of esteem to keep things somewhat tidy (but not too much).

But what this means in practise, is that I just code. I use my Svelte boilerplate or something else, and then just go from there. Find a solid example, refactor it to my purposes. Look from a tutorial. Copy from my own old project. Or in case it's just grunt work, I just put together some simple version. Nothing fancy. And, it just so happens, my projects progress. Bit by bit I mold them into shape and if not make the most optimal solution, I think I arrive at least to a working compromise.

Apart from coding, my other computer-related hobby is writing. I like writing. May it be simple blog posts like this (with which I have somewhat poor track record) or creative works like lyrics or stories. With lyrics I've found somewhat similar process to programming - just find what works and don't overthink it too much. There's always the next song if this one doesn't seem to come out that good. With writing prose however, things change.

I don't exactly know why writing prose (novels, short stories) is so hard to me. Me, who has spent much of my life hitting buttons a keyboard and dedicated my career to writing program code. I do have written stuff, of course, such as this short story and other, longer texts that may not be in publishable shape. Yet still, the process somehow eludes me still. Why writing prose is god damn difficult?

For the longest time I have had only an inkling theory that programming is more like laying bricks and writing books is more like painting. It's pretty basic what you do in programming, not going to lie. WIth a logical mind and some work ethic, your brain will soon adapt to the monotone rhythm of laying code bricks or fix some obscure bugs. It's just little brain teasers with a little bit of artistic creativity as you lay down your project structure or style your components.

With writing, my mind is constantly involved with what I write. There is no exact pattern or logical way of doing things. You just come up with stuff out of your ass and make it sound somewhat sensible. Which gets increasingly more difficult the more story you have behind you, as you recall the parameters of the world you have built. Writing a scene and remembering only afterwards it's techinically impossible, really sucks the joy out of the process.

At best you get an inspiration. A sudden melody that the muse of the creation is singing to your ear and it all comes out of you naturally "this is how it always was meant to go." As happened with writing this blog post. Or the inspiration to write a song. But these occasions are rather rare and often the metal cools and the smart plot lines don't seem that smart after all. As with all things.

Yet coming back to it — not having written anything in a while. I do feel a rather heavy burden that I have to lift to get comfortable with writing prose again. And this is what I feel is my biggest dilemma — with programming it's now so easy, what I am doing wrong with writing?

The muscles a routine builds up in your brain can't be overlooked of course, when comparing the two. If you do one thing for a long time, it probably gets easier the more you progress. Also there's the social learning — I've grown as programmer probably the most as I've worked together with others, especially in the beginning. There's something to be said about having someone who can guide you over those hazardously looking pitfalls that seem to lurk in every corner with programming. And also just the content about programming I have consumed — so many opinions and techinques I've stored in the back of my mind incase they come handy.

Yet with writing, I feel like a monkey with a typewriter. For me, the most optimal process has become writing long hand first on some notebook and later transferring it to into latex chapters I keep in git. Simulating the feeling of committing a solid feature in the version history is rather satisfying. And with long hand — something about it helps to focus better and as I start at the blank paper for a while, I'll just start jotting down _something._ Just something to fill the page.

And this I think is the key. We humans are kind of pattern-seeking monsters which easily get focused on the wrong things in the wrong times. We shouldn't try to edit ourselves as we continue writing our stories - just follow the main plot points and you should be fine. Having to use primitive tools like pen and paper rather enhance that feeling of scrappy first draft. And this process is rather like a muscle that needs developing, like climbing a mountain you have to break it into multiple evenings when you dedicate say your last day's last (or first) hours to it.

But writing those first words. What a horrible struggle. Yet I believe, now that I have this higher point of view, one must achieve the same transformation of process from **thinking** about writing (or coding) to just **doing it.**

I remember first when I did this with programming, it did kinda hurt. Forcing myself to work fast was exhausting and my mind whined to have some relief in the form of news articles or other junk internet is full. But, after a while, the breakthrough happened and the pain lessened to a point where I felt okay with working fast. Still a little bit pain and sometimes I could get side-tracked by over-complicating something. Our brains need fresh stimuli, after all. Until at some point, as I internalized the benefits of it — progressing side projects, good reviews at work — I started to like it. Like it a lot more than the meandering way of researching too much and thinking about the code as I did before.

I doubt as I after writing the first draft of this blog post, will attempt continue my story will have that much success with this new paradigm. But maybe. Maybe you just have to force yourself to block out all the noise from "this is too exhausting" to "I wonder what's in my phone" to achieve the elusive **flow state** that writers so much yap about it. I believe turning this lever is somewhat harder to code as I can't really copy-paste my old boilerplate and use the same chapters as I did in some other story to keep my pace high. The creative mind is thinking mind, to some extent, but the leap is still there. The commitment of **doing something** instead of mulling about it.

Maybe you too can try it and send a comment how it went. Am I taking crazy pills here or is there really a mindset you forcefully should choose each time you want to really write?

Also, the one reason why writing long hand works for me so well is that it's slow enough for me to visualize the things I write as I write them. For me a major thing is imagining what I write and experiencing it in full detail, otherwise I feel my abstract logical mind takes control and I write what I _think_ the characters should say without actually _feeling_ them say it. It's hard to explain but I really do hear my characters talking as I think my dialogue. As well as see the places I set my scenes at.

AND also having good background music as you write (or edit) can help staying in the right mood for your story.

# Update

So, it seems it did work. After staring at the blank page for a while and begrudignly filling it without having a clear idea, I got a sudden revelation after a while and the story just bubbled out of me. I then proceeded to fill 7 A4 pages (with blank lines between paragraphs, so not that full) of somewhat decent quality.

But this occurrence can't be observed without context. During the last 4 days I've slowly recovered from a session of heavy ethanol ingestion as well as detoxing myself from the hedonistic loop of watching Youtube videos and whatnot. It is apparent, you need to ramp up before your brains fully become aligned with the task you want to perform (be it writing or programming) and removing distractions to xxx your focus seems crucial.

Yet I think as important factors are the change of my diet, now that I am back at home where I can cook my low-carb meals that keep my sated all day long. I have come to a conclusion that it's near impossible to work on tasks requiring deep thinking on high-carb diet. My blood sugar at least seems to fluctuate too much to keep my focus clear. Also, after a week long break I started going jogging and going to gym again. The act of physical exercise really seems to instill concentration in me and relax my body, allowing me to stay put and pour my mind onto something as boring as writing without being xxx by something else.

There are many things in play, that I think helped to reach this temporary bliss of lubricated writing. Having clear sheets, clean room and some nice thematic background as well I think provided me with the necessary foundations that I could, perhaps synthetically, achieve a sudden "inspiration" to write which made it feel almost easy. The major factor being detaching myself from the incessant loop of having to numb my brains with the virtual dopamine.

As a takeway, here are some factors that I think help you to focus better on writing:

- things
- When I feel tired, do two to three sets of squat jumps and push ups. In 30 to 60 minutes you should notice increased alacrity and ability to focus

One other experiment I did, was tempering myself to obey my super ego without hesitation. For example, instead of going through the "I don't wanna" "well if I have to" cycle when doing eg. those squat jumps, I would _without thinking_ just do it as it occurred to me. It is kinda tough to do, I admit it, but I remember after some point my nagging defence against anything exhausting turned into mindless acceptance, which then led to accomplishing a lot of stuff — house work, course exercises, music. Only downside, apart from the hard ramp up, as I remember was lessened ability to day dream about stories and things in general. My mind just wanted to execute, execute, execute — anything that needed doing.

After which, the only thing remaining is writing itself. For me, this is writing long hand on a notebook. Writing out either a pre-planned plot point or just throwing something on the paper and seeing after few paragraphs, if it works. Imagining the whole scene in my mind all the while. One trick I've also noticed is that you when you feel stuck, you can jump forward to the part where you have a clear idea what happens eg. the big action twist. Minimizing thinking and focusing on what to actually write seems to, in conjunction, grease your neurons to just turn the faucet of creativity on. Do the editing later. And less is often more, it's easier to add stuff later than it's to constantly write beautifully descriptive and vivid scenes.

Hope this helps!

# More

It seems there are parts of the day that are more suitable for writing type of deep focus work. In the morning, after you have woken up. Especially when you limit your access to internet. For example, keeping my laptop closed and just using my phone to check a few HackerNews posts and putting on some music, really helped me to focus on writing on my notebook. And once I opened it, I almost hesitated to spend too much time on it as I started to feel cognitive burden from ingesting too many things at once.

Then, after lunch and in late evening seems to work best for me. At any point when my blood sugar runs low, I seem to lose my sharpest edge for concentration but that's fine. As long as I prevent myself from indulging too much into the stream of bombardment from internet, especially with laptop as that seems to allow easiest access. Probably closing all the browser windows and even wifi could help, as a small barrier for the brainless browsing but I think pen and paper is the best for me.

Curious how easy in the end it was to fall into proper writing-habit once I setup my environment to be distraction free and as stable as possible. I think the overlap between being proficient programmer and writer is quite strong, as long as you give yourself the time to develop the routine. And, of course, have developed your writing voice well enough so that you know your "syntax". Minimizing the thinking part seems to work wonders — you'll rewrite the whole thing once or twice at least. Just put the unusued chapters and paragraphs in some "snippets" file or let them vanish into version history. Nothing goes to waste, in the end, as long as you keep progressing.
