# Introduction

After years of torturing my brains with the most tedious JavaScript dependency errors, CSS layout bugs and even some Rust borrow checker problems, I've reached a point where I can start a coding project and just "do it." By doing it, I mean I have become so practised in hacking away code that I impetiously just start writing without thinking about too much. This goes here and that goes there. Only when I reach unknown new paths I've never seen before, I might have to stop to think. However, even then I have developed an instinct to pick the one that seems the most suitable and not worry too much about the details of it. Most of the time.

The way I've reached this point is mostly through work and building my own projects. With work you most likely always want to be fast (to show you're doing stuff) but at times things can become a little mellow. With my own projects, however, I have noticed becoming increasingly impatient in building them. I think I've finally got the "cute programming" out of my system and just want to see something actual tangible ASAP. With style, of course. I hold myself to that much of esteem to keep things somewhat tidy (but not too much).

But what this means in practise, is that I just code. I use my Svelte boilerplate or something else, and then just go from there. Find a solid example, refactor it to my purposes. Look from a tutorial. Copy from my own old project. Or in case it's just grunt work, I just put together some simple version. Nothing fancy. And, it just so happens, my projects progress. Bit by bit I mold them into shape and if not make the most optimal solution, I think I arrive at least to a working compromise.

Apart from coding, my other computer-related hobby is writing. I like writing. May it be simple blog posts like this (with which I have somewhat poor track record) or creative works like lyrics or stories. With lyrics I've found somewhat similar process to programming - just find what works and don't overthink it too much. There's always the next song if this one doesn't seem to come out that good. With writing prose however, things change.

I don't exactly know why writing prose (novels, short stories) is so hard to me. Me, who has spent much of my life hitting buttons a keyboard and dedicated my career to writing program code. I do have written stuff, of course, such as this short story and other, longer texts that may not be in publishable shape. Yet still, the process somehow eludes me still. Why writing prose is god damn difficult?

For the longest time I have had only an inkling theory that programming is more like laying bricks and writing books is more like painting. It's pretty basic what you do in programming, not going to lie. WIth a logical mind and some work ethic, your brain will soon adapt to the monotone rhythm of laying code bricks or fix some obscure bugs. It's just little brain teasers with a little bit of artistic creativity as you lay down your project structure or style your components.

With writing, my mind is constantly involved with what I write. There is no exact pattern or logical way of doing things. You just come up with stuff out of your ass and make it sound somewhat sensible. Which gets increasingly more difficult the more story you have behind you, as you recall the parameters of the world you have built. Writing a scene and remembering only afterwards it's techinically impossible, really sucks the joy out of the process.

At best you get an inspiration. A sudden melody that the muse of the creation is singing to your ear and it all comes out of you naturally "this is how it always was meant to go." As happened with writing this blog post. Or the inspiration to write a song. But these occasions are rather rare and often the metal cools and the smart plot lines don't seem that smart after all. As with all things.

Yet coming back to it — not having written anything in a while. I do feel a rather heavy burden that I have to lift to get comfortable with writing prose again. And this is what I feel is my biggest dilemma — with programming it's now so easy, what I am doing wrong with writing?

The muscles a routine builds up in your brain can't be overlooked of course, when comparing the two. If you do one thing for a long time, it probably gets easier the more you progress. Also there's the social learning — I've grown as programmer probably the most as I've worked together with others, especially in the beginning. There's something to be said about having someone who can guide you over those hazardously looking pitfalls that seem to lurk in every corner with programming. And also just the content about programming I have consumed — so many opinions and techinques I've stored in the back of my mind incase they come handy.

Yet with writing, I feel like a monkey with a typewriter. For me, the most optimal process has become writing long hand first on some notebook and later transferring it to into latex chapters I keep in git. Simulating the feeling of committing a solid feature in the version history is rather satisfying. And with long hand — something about it helps to focus better and as I start at the blank paper for a while, I'll just start jotting down _something._ Just something to fill the page.

And this I think is the key. We humans are kind of pattern-seeking monsters which easily get focused on the wrong things in the wrong times. We shouldn't try to edit ourselves as we continue writing our stories - just follow the main plot points and you should be fine. Having to use primitive tools like pen and paper rather enhance that feeling of scrappy first draft. And this process is rather like a muscle that needs developing, like climbing a mountain you have to break it into multiple evenings when you dedicate say your last day's last (or first) hours to it.

But writing those first words. What a horrible struggle. Yet I believe, now that I have this higher point of view, one must achieve the same transformation of process from **thinking** about writing (or coding) to just **doing it.**

I remember first when I did this with programming, it did kinda hurt. Forcing myself to work fast was exhausting and my mind whined to have some relief in the form of news articles or other junk internet is full. But, after a while, the breakthrough happened and the pain lessened to a point where I felt okay with working fast. Still a little bit pain and sometimes I could get side-tracked by over-complicating something. Our brains need fresh stimuli, after all. Until at some point, as I internalized the benefits of it — progressing side projects, good reviews at work — I started to like it. Like it a lot more than the meandering way of researching too much and thinking about the code as I did before.

I doubt as I after writing the first draft of this blog post, will attempt continue my story will have that much success with this new paradigm. But maybe. Maybe you just have to force yourself to block out all the noise from "this is too exhausting" to "I wonder what's in my phone" to achieve the elusive **flow state** that writers so much yap about it. I believe turning this lever is somewhat harder to code as I can't really copy-paste my old boilerplate and use the same chapters as I did in some other story to keep my pace high. The creative mind is thinking mind, to some extent, but the leap is still there. The commitment of **doing something** instead of mulling about it.

Maybe you too can try it and send a comment how it went. Am I taking crazy pills here or is there really a mindset you forcefully should choose each time you want to really write?

Also, the one reason why writing long hand works for me so well is that it's slow enough for me to visualize the things I write as I write them. For me a major thing is imagining what I write and experiencing it in full detail, otherwise I feel my abstract logical mind takes control and I write what I _think_ the characters should say without actually _feeling_ them say it. It's hard to explain but I really do hear my characters talking as I think my dialogue. As well as see the places I set my scenes at.
