# Foreword

Warning: this is not an opinion for or against either Palestian or Israeli people. I do not want to take sides in that discussion, I merely just want to portray how the situation in Ukraine now, 11.2024, makes me understand Palestians's pain better. I'm at the moment feeling heavily that Ukraine's future is at stake right now, and I have to to pour out these thoughts somewhere.

# Trump 2.0

So right now, Donald Trump has become the president elect of United States. This is probably the biggest news of the whole year, even _trumping_ his own assasination attempt. Now I won't say anything about him or the democractic candidate, just that now I've come to now acknowledge that things sometimes just don't get better even though you wish it so. And the situation in Ukraine hasn't improved, therefore the equation of how it would is hard to come to terms with. I, of course, as a Finnish citizen and the 2nd generation victim of similar Russian aggression, am all for helping Ukraine as best as we can.

But that comes with a price. Monetary and political price, to be exact. US and EU have had to put up huge amounts of money to basically just vaporize it all in puffs of smoke. And what for? This all is net-negative for everyone involved. How is it possible that in 2024, we are now seeing this absolute destruction of human lives and property and so close to the Western ideas and nations?

# Putin

So uhh. I have now went on a little bit of podcast spree to try to understand the politics behind it, especially from the side of the Trump-team. Listening RFK Jr describing NATO as just a mere con for selling US made arms after the break of Soviet Union makes my stomach turn. Seeing what Russia has done in Abkhazia, Transnistria it's _clear_ that NATO is absolutely necessary to deter Russia from poking its finger into its neighbouring countries. We, Finland, have been the gold standard for trying hold a balance of not aggravating Russia by constantly sucking up to it and letting its influence weigh heavy on our internal affairs.

And from researching what people have said and has been written into Wikipedia, I have come to an acute understandment what a devil of a man Vladimir Putin is. Born and bred in the dystopian security machine of USSR and risen through ranks by his sheer unscrupulousness, there seems to be not a single shred of empathy left in that hollow human shell. Man has literally murdered thousands — and counting the casualties of the war — hundreds of thousands. And for what? To satisfy the ritualistic sacrifice for the growling belly of greater Russia?

You can't probably pick up my gravitas on this issue of what I just said and it didn't really hit me as well until recently. I am, after all, a normal decent human being who thinks good of most of us. But I think I have now finally understood. **Truly** understood. That underneath all of this facade of human warmth, which most of us share, there still exists Ted Bundies and Zodiac Killers right in the open for anyone to see. Who — with their uncanny intelligence and ability to sustain their worst impulses — are absolutely more terrifying, ravenous monsters. Whose only mission now is to see their name stamped into the annals of history. Just below Stalin.

Unbelievable tragedy. Of course, you could rationalize it that Russia has a casus belli. That since Ukrainians decided to exile the old corrupt puppet Yanukovych and choose better lives for themselves as part of Europe and Western sphere of influence, Putin had a good reason to intervene. A lame, xxx reason as this is straight from Russia's own playbook it has used in other ex-Soviet countries. For what I can only see as a long held dream of reuniniting Crimea to Russia which, to be fair, was conquered with blood and cannon shells from Turks & Tatars. Who probably conquered them from someone else, but I digress.

# Pre-2022 Europe

But. They say in Finland that "hunger grows as you eat." This is what must have happened to him as well. And looking back I am filled with horror seeing the soft, puffy and dull faces of European leaders in silly democratic meetings with this monster. Angela Merkel, while very wise politician I'm sure, failed completely to see this dark corner of Putin's mind. And who would have, since there wasn't anything to indicate that he would truly do it. Well, he _had_ done some pretty atrocious things long before that as well so... Uhh... I suppose me and the rest of Europe have been sleep-walking in the fantasy land of post-Soviet world where only peace and harmony would thrive.

Rather strange. Rather sad. Having had the time now to put all of this together, it has really hit me hard how supremely evil people still exist in this world, live and well, in great positions of power. With malice so terrible, that in a movie it would drive people out of the theathre due to its nauseating effect.

Human lives as mere pawns and fuel to drive the ego and vanity of a man? Yes, Russia could become a moderate superpower again due to its size and resources. But to think that this would be the way? I believe similar to a man, a nation's soul can writhe and die not because of its lack of vitality but because every brick of the foundation it stands on, is laid with mortar and blood. Unless you rectify it somehow or. It causes itself its doom.

How heavy thoughts... Wait, Palestine? Oh yeah.

# Palestine

Due to the sadness of Ukraine basically having to concede enormous amounts of land, I can now see and understand the pain of the Palestinians having to concede their homeland to the so-called "returnees." With UN resolution and great justification, sure, they divided up a nation and unlike Finland, Germany and others, their shared consciousness could not accept it.

Probably atrocities happened during that time, driving the wedge deeper as did the intoxicating fume of religion to banish the colonizing infidels. But I have to admit — to be honest with you and myself — that jewish having had to suffer Holocaust and being reasonably Western, I do feel deep sympathy for them as well. And I think I'm not alone on this.

But I can see now clearly where the pain of Palestians stem from. And it is this wound that once you realize and never resolve (through official peace treaty), will never heal as Israel feels too tempted by its recolonization of the ancient hills of West Bank.

# Waiting for the good guys

What an awful, cruel world, and I really feel now I'd rather not be part of it. Having to just close my eyes from this as a person with no influence, standing and watching afar, as lives and borders are irrevocably being drawn from the guts and flesh of human bodies. But I think I want to know this feeling, as to pretend I do not see it is just another self-deception that would eventually poison my soul and blur my eyes from seeing clearly.

# Afterthoughts

Huh. This subject just doesn't leave me alone. Right, once you get past the horror of the situation, I can see basically 3 options:

## Forced Russian victory

Ukraine concedes all of its occupied areas in exchange of direct security guarantees from US, other Western powers and future EU membership. The most terrible option but also the most likely. I wish NATO membership would also be on the table but considering Mr Trump and Putin's hatred towards it, I doubt it. Probably Taiwan's security model.

## Reason's victory

Ukraine concedes only the areas that were predominatably Russian before the war — Crimea, Donets, Luhansk — in exchange of peace treaty and security guarantees. In my opinion the most sensible solution whether there is any humanity in Mr Putin's heart. Being graceful Putin could rapidly increase Russia's reintegration into EU's and USA's economy. However, knowing him to be the devil he is and the lives of the Russians dead invading those areas, unlikely.

## ????

Russia is in relatively strong position to play time against Mr Trump who is probably more concerned with other areas. And considering how adverse he is about expenditure, he wouldn't enjoy helping Ukraine but the absolutely minimal amount. However, given that Trump wants to force the negotiations in one way or another, I don't think Russia can afford f\*cking around with a known maniac as he could, in theory, provide Ukraine even stronger weapons. But as I say, this is the least likely. Being the prudent and somewhat sociopathic business man, he probably wants the thing done quick and without being particularly empathetic to Zelensky.

Huh. God. Rationalizing this somehow helped to me alleviate some of the pain. Slava Ukraini but dark are the days ahead for you. Though, if this goes through, you'll be much better off than in the grips of this mad imperialistic xxx.

## v2

Oh. OH. Now I get it. Actually, Ukraine has never been in danger with Trump becoming US president. Russia is the one facing a humiliating defeat by an opponent third of its size (population-wise). While at the moment (10.11.2024) it seems that Ukraine is in dire need of help, it actually is doing pretty well considering how low on morale and men Russians are. It hasn't recaptured its territories yet, but given time and the better equipment of Ukraine, it definitely would.

However, I see now how more ugly and wasteful the war could get. Ukrainians plowing through the mine fields and fortifications, retaking cities. Invading Crimea. And the funding! Ukraine would probably need another package of subsisidied military goods that US & co are happy to provide, given it would go to a "good cause." Maintain democracy, weaken Russia and profit from the war! How wonderful.

Now the question then is, is it a good idea to yield Crimea back to Russia? It was given as a gift by krutchev in 1957, in true drunken Russian fashion, as it was between two brother nations. Yet giving it back would create a rather dangerous xxx ennakkotapaus. If invading does work, wouldn't Russia, or others, do it again on a similar excuse later on? Just slowly stockpile gold and amass forces until you think you can with a decapating strike take out your target.

Of course you ensure the victim stays out of NATO and other harmful treaties that would cause a swift end to your little special excursion. China is probably the only other nation on Earth that is interested in this type of maneuver.

But geopolitics is indeed a waiting game. I believe that as Putin came to power, he received a set of notes or ideas from his predecessor, Yeltsin, who instilled into him the idea of re-establishing the Soviet sphere of influence. Ensure that NATO doesn't expand, then slowly grow in power and keep the other coutnries in a false sense of security. Then, as they helplessly lean towards Moscow in order to keep them happy and actually want to pull out of Moscow's gravity and join NATO (or/and EU), invade a portion of the country to keep them in frozen conflict.

How unspeakably evil.

One another solution to the war is to maintain the frontlines and slowly drain out the Russian economy until it simply crashes, thus making the maintenance or manufacturing of new shells impossible. _Could be_, in fact, that this has been Ukraine's and West's strategy all along. And Russia has floundered directly into it by attempting assault after assault and achieving maybe a few kilometre's worth of barren land while at the same time paying for it dearly.

Possibly the latest Kursk incursion has really made Russia bleed heavily.

But anyway, time will tell. I was worried sick for a moment — especially with Trump's victory — as nobody has really explained where this war is going.

I am incredibly worried for our future. Bunch of so-called "strong men" are going to hold all the keys to power with remarkably shady histories and large egos. The thesis of Trump campaign, return to good old days with promise of wealth and xxx, is enticing x in its simplicity. Yet what we might lose in turn is much more.

I have personal belief that Trump has some kind of deal with Putin going on. Either it's related to safety, past mistakes or to keep Trump line prominent in the years to come, he has such a xx that it makes me worry. Why you ask? It's the little thiings: not meeting Zelensky when he came to US during elections. Providing him Covid-kits during the worst days of 2020. Putin is a murderer with capital M and the fact 50% of the population thinks siding with him is better than being "a stupid lib" is excruciating.

I know, ideology doesn't seem to matter in America anymore. It's all about who can bamboozle and speak lies the most confidently better.

Same with Musk. The man has something nefarious going on. What worries me is his incredibly thin ego that demands vengeance for all the wrong-doings that "left" has done.

Huh. I pray for Ukraine and swift end to Trump presidency. I wish he did well this time, for the good of all, but I can't extinguish the fear what I saw last time.

What I think happened in Ukraine was, after 2014 there was a common understanding that Ukraine was neutral — for the time being. This continued until 2021, when Biden & Harris changed something. I'm not sure what but probably related to providing funds & equipment for Ukraine's military and promise of NATO membership. AND that Crimea _wouldn't_ be handed off to — the international borders of Ukraine would be xxx sustained.

This was a red line for Putin who became furious, as to him Crimea is Russia proper, and he played the scenarios in his head and saw that Russia would lose Crimea if he were to let this happen. And so, in psychotic fury,

What I've thought could happen, given the gravity of the matter and how things are looking, is that Ukraine concedes Crimea in exchange for other territories Russia has conquered as well as NATO membership. AND, I think this would be an enormously good time to dispell the destabilization by Russia in Europe, namely in Georgia and Moldova. As well as providing Japan that one Kurill island to make things fair and square for everybody, since we are now remeding old "mistakes."
