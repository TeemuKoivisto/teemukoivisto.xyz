# Introduction

Everybody seems worried AI will take their jobs, especially now in software development. But I say, in the future everyone _is a programmer._ Does it dilute the poolâ€“yes, but.

Also, taking this a step further; in the future, everyone will be Reneissance man (or person, for more PC term). It will be so easy to learn to do things, that you can pretty much decide on a whim to do something and become relatively acquinted with it over a week and then proceed doing it.

Yes, maybe this is overblown and majority of people will wander in the darkness of intellectual poverty where they never mastered one subject (such as programming) to use that same mental model in mastering other subjects.
