# Introduction

We all want to achieve something in life. Or at least you'd hope.

To pursue this great big task, there are many intermediate tasks on the way that seem to be always on our way — _if only I did **this** one thing it will change everything._. Well anyway. It's somewhat ridiculous to believe we somehow achieve all of these things by our own work alone _yet_ there are ways to at least put ourselves in the _right_ state of mind to pursue them.

What do I mean? Well, I've long thought that we humans behave on _loops._ Very similar to how robots behave with **control-loops** yet since we are smarter ours are more indeterminate. Right?

Which is true yet I've noticed myself getting carried away by these sudden inspirations that have seemingly come out of nowhere yet pretty certainly _have_ come out of somewhere. For example, an inspiration to practise music — I heard some live music or found a new artist. Or read an article about 10 best songwriting tricks. For programming: I might have seen a cool GitHub project or a blog post about something that has put my brains in motion. And so on.

There are constant forces around us that bombard us with their input and we in turn react to those inputs in certain way. More specifically, I've found that once we get into this mood of certain subject we are really spiraling into deeper and deeper until we finally have to hit the reset button and go to sleep (or something else). All things come to pass. Eventually, we might lose that initial spark of inspiration and the thing just slips away from us — one moment at the time. Another things comes to dominate our thoughts.

Okay sure this does not apply to everything. We go to work not because we suddenly get inspired by some LinkedIn post every morning but because we have to. However, at one point I am sure you had the moment of inspiration to pursue your profession and later on — through consuming of related content or just applying for a school — you were drowned into the loop of achieving your goal of employment.

Well, you probably can see where I am going with this. So you saw a TikTok video of some douche making a buck producing some most basic content and thought "I can do this". Or you've long held a secret dream of publishing your first book. Or whatever — coding your own app.

To bring that thing into reality you need A) persistence B) time C) motivation and optional D) talent. I think over-xx talent has been blown out of proportion and with regular keen mind you can get pretty far to a level of satisfactory mediocrity.

Now, however, you have to construct your plan. The How.

I'm not going to suggest anything here — you probably now a lot better in whatever area you're interested in than me. **But.** I bet this involves in producing a constant loop or sorts. Calling out a buddy who shares similar interests to work something together. Or going to a class, to a school. We humans are very much attuned to our surroundings and being surrounded by like-minded and oriented people will steer us very sternly towards that shared goal.

This is something you probably have yourself already figured out but I can't emphasize enough the value of these social settings and routine structures. For any hobby or interest I view as my turning point the moment I am able to provide my own version or my own way of doing things — without outside help. And internalize my own vision so deeply that I no longer have to be constantly reminded by my teacher to practise before lessons — I will do it on my own already.

Now, for the less fortunate people who have interests that aren't shared by that many or is just hard to socialize with (or you just don't want to) things get a little more complicated. This is also where I struggle with when there is no more social support. Side-projects after work with no enforced deadlines or goals. Writing something with no one available who would want to read it (or care what you produce).

I consider myself having a reasonably good persistence and stamina with these things. I do tend to get things done over the long-term. However, this might take a while _and_ also I might get frustrated and drop the thing for good.

So what can you do? Here's my collection of the best tricks I've found:

### Just doing it

You just empty your mind and start hitting the buttons. Block out all the rest and let your subconscious lizard take over. The important part is _deciding_ and committing to it fully. Similar to how you might lift heavy weights in the gym — your body can not think of anything else and soon (after the discomfort has passed) you find yourself getting into the flow. You can think of it as your brain buffering the situation and evicting the useless chatter and doubt in return.

This is probably the best trick which always works if you truly decide to do it. It's just little rough sometimes and also finding the conviction to decide that strongly to do something can be hard to find at times.

### Eliminating distractions

As the jump from complete indolence to total commitment is a tad hard to _decide_, I find it much easier when I steer myself first from the useless activities and slowly let my subconscious pick up the clues that I should do _something_ probably right now.

This includes blocking Youtube which, if I need to really watch a video, involves some resistance as I have to change it from the settings each time do.

For writing I've noticed that with computer it's too easy for me to get side-tracked. Just the need for little research here and there turns into a binge xxx of Wikipedia with my focus totally gone. Also the easiness of editing makes it harder for me to just _write._

Instead, I've found writing long-hand much better for myself. Just scribbling to a notebook in evenings I feel no pressure of over-editing or researching and it allows me to completely focus on writing. Also helps with reduced screentime.

### Easing into it

This is perhaps the method I was first inspired to write this article about. Sometimes just eliminating distractions and deciding isn't enough to make you feel like you want to do something. In that case, I recommend a sprinkle of inspiration.

Here I'd allow myself to watch a few videos or read some articles in a related subject which I'd wish to perform. Analyses of songs for music. Programming rage-bait or start-up success stories for coding. Writers talking about their craft or book reviews. Introduction videos — whatever.

The point is you attempt to reproduce a positive athmosphere relating to that thing you want to do and then — seemingly like out of nowhere — you find yourself wanting to do just a little bit. Juuuust a little to see whether your material is any good that what you just saw.

Or you get completely side-tracked and end up wasting your time.

In those cases, it might be better to just hit a reset button and let your brain run out of gear. You'll eventually hit some ground (I hope). To rebounce back to where you want to be headed at. Hey, that rhymed.

In larger context it's always important to see the bigger picture and it might be just that your brain is signaling that instead of grinding on yet anotehr side-project you should focus on some more concrete realities. I recommend hanging around people in those cases and just talking bullshit. It might help to see what's the problem.

And sometimes when you feel really uninspired and there's no pressing deadline to meet — congratulate yourself! You've succeeded in managing your most pressing topics and now you can take it easy as well. Work at your own leisurely pace or do whatever. Don't let the nagging feeling of accomplishing something to rob you of this wonderful moment of absolute freedom in deciding what to do.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are many ways to bamboozle yourself but sometimes you are being bamboozled by bamboozling. Then just chill and try to enjoy things.
