# Introduction

I'll here coin a trendy term for a simple thing we probably all are familiar with.

Here's the setup: you have two equally unready candidates. Just two very green persons who neither have really any proven track-record. Blank sheets, basically. And you've assessed that they are equally (un)skilled. They can do a fizz-buzz but you know they'll need a lot of guidance to get to a productive level of profiency.

Which do you pick? The more heterogenous entry to your worker pool? **bzzzzt** - wrong! At least in this political climate. In your head, you have some Bayesian priors you are not even aware that lean you towards one option or the other. Perhaps a hobby you like, sentence they said, some minor detail about their upbringing. Something very very unscientific to estimate the candidate who is more likely to succeed _and_, of course, to stay in the company and contribute to its culture.

But. In my mind, I would frame this as a question of the right **framework of mind.** A rather pompous and abstract sounding term for a "better qualified person" but hear me out.

At its essence, all these wonderful properties of the two candidates reduce into yes or no answer. We call it as "hiring the most qualified for the job" even though they may not even account for such high acclaim, it's just that they were "better" for reason or another. Working 10 years at a rather obscure company versus someone who had a brief stint at Google _and_ 5 years at a obscure company, probably biases the choice towards the Google-candidate.

And that is yes, outsourced validation by trusted entity, but also a proof of a successful **framework of mind.** See, to be successful at _anything_ is not trivial. Unless that something requires you only to exist. It takes time and patience and dedication to understand systems and to evolve your instincts, so that you can solve even unknown problems without getting lost. A proven ability to build a simple structure, so to speak, within your mind as a framework to solve problems.

What would this mean in practise? A security guard might develop a keen eye of seeing potential trouble-makers as well as stern voice, to diffuse tension with authority rather than going for full body tackle every time. A clerk resistance to repetitive and monotonous tasks that need to be done over and over again every day. A bus driver spatial memory of roads, bus stops, the dimensions of the vehicle as it's navigated through various obstacles. A programmer a knack for inferring logical steps and relationships between as they were entities of program code.

We humans, naturally try to exert as little energy as possible in doing things so we, lazy as we are, collect our empirical evidences into simplified systems—tools rather—within our head. We don't pick a new language or framework if we want to make some simple website for our dog (well, actually a dog programming language sounds pretty insanely fun). We have enough data in our heads, that we can evaluate options quicker and more robustly, averting wasting time on dead-ends or just making us work more for apparent zero benefit (although this could an issue for the employer).

Yes, I am describing **experience** in its base form. We know the mistakes and we know how to avoid them. Simple. And, we get stuff done.

But to further iterate on the point of the framework of the mind. It's rare that one profession or experience really revolutionizes your mind so that you have a ready-made machine to solve every problem you face. The process takes years and there is no short-cuts, no one "right" way. We develop—and abandon—biases constantly that fail the continous optimization process within our head. "Be assertive, it makes you get things." "But don't be too assertive, as you can appear like an asshole." And so on.

This development happens, we like it or not, as it directly maps to our enjoyment of our existence. Although, detrimental divergences do happen. Probably due to over-stimulation by our own pleasure chemicals.

Now, as an employer choosing between these two candidates, I'd say the one who we choose is the one with the better framework of mind. The one, who seems to be more responsive to feedback. The one, who after failing once readjusts and figures out an alternative solution. Is it just being intelligent? Not necessarily, but rather being more adaptive to the external stimuli so that their present framework, gut instinct, is aligned closer to the optimal path than not.

And frameworks change as well. Or rather, your framework needs to recalibrate itself on constant basis. As an example, young students are notoriously annoying as they've studied hard, learned a lot, have their young brains unsullied by the weight of the world and are ready beat down anyone on any illogical argument they've made. That _can_ work in some circustances—and is definitely helpful when answering professors' trick questions—but is rather detrimental to their soft skills. So, the first thing that they hopefully develop in their first real job is letting go of such egoistic snarkiness. Adapt their framework.

One other example could be between knowing how to party and how to fix a program bug. These are two, quite opposite I might add, frameworks of mind which each might need more nurture depending on the person.

And some parts are impossible to change. Or at least fully. It may be our natural brain chemistry or the environment we grew up in, but some patterns within our framework can be rather insurmountable to change. Call it fixed settings or just plain stubborness, it's something that we have to constantly reflect our adaptions against. We might receive a new knowledge or experience that showed us a path towards happier day to day life. Yet, due to our defiencies, we can not adapt it in our framework. It just doesn't fit.

What do we do? Go to therapy? Talk to an AI chatbot? Just forget its existence? Or just push through and adapt no matter what?

This last option is actually something that I find rather interesting. I don't know about you, dear reader, but I've at times had to confront my ineffective framework by having to pick an uncomfortable option—probably due to social pressure—by placing my emotions aside and pushing through. It's rather counter-intuitive to _logically_ decide something, switch off your emotions, and then just do it. Not what I'd recommend as your go-to framework but it's rather handy when you **have to** make something happen and not just give up on it. I'd argue that Americans are rather good at that compared to say Finns like myself.

Anyway. I think I've put enough words here that you get my point. A **framework of mind** is an abstract term that you could use to categorize "life experience" or "street smarts" with. Both imply a certain approach to solving things which also don't necessarily reduce your overall depth of your framework(s). Hmm, I suppose the definition between a single framework, a style of an approach, and a collection of them might need a little more philosophical pondering. I'd say framework of mind is a superset and it can hold multiple cutely nicknamed (such as street smart) subsets. But suggestions are welcome!
