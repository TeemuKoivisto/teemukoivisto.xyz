Something about the hat thingy.

Except that I talk about mindsets.

## 1st: ideation, free-form ideas. Let it flow man.

## 2nd: exploration of tools

## 3rd: quick prototyping / hard work

Often the hardest step, especially for those whole loved the idea stage.
Key here is to forget the previous stage's optimization of selecting the right tool and just pushing through. There might be issues, yes, but unless _really_ necessary you should just get to the finish line **and then** choosing the right tools for the next version.

But what happens if you go back to the exploration mindset (or God forbid, ideation) you'll fall into the so-called analysis-paralysis and your output will be zero which demotivates you even further. You really should aim for putting your blinders and on steam-rolling ahead, regardless of how hacky solutions you have to make, to the next stage.

Your brain might at start resist the notion of letting go of analyzing your tools, your idea et cetera, but something happens if you just empty your mind and code. Don't think about anything but getting it done. It's so weirdly efficient method which only downside is that it feels a little exhausting in the beginning (but just give it a couple of days) and you might get consumed by the project that it burns you out if you push too long.

This is why it's important to spec out your first version as something you're comfortable you can accomplish in the time you feel allocating to the project. Otherwise, it might become a drag and an eternal time sink which, needless to say, is bad to produce something usable.

## 4th: user acquisition / retrospect / marketing / putting it out there

## 5th: polishment

## 6th: next iteration

## final words

Now, this all makes it seem that the end goal of all the projects is to hack together a prototype to swing at your Linkedin followers or whatnot. Sometimes projects are more usable as failed experiments rather than long grinds with equally disappointing results.

For projects however that you do want to finish, I dare say this is somewhat similar to the process we all go through and I'd say it's wise to realize when you need to switch gears. There are no specific time limits I've put for each stage nor are they exactly lined up with each other. Of course we all evaluate our idea and project in each stage, did we want it or not, but to clearly separate your modes of working does help me at least to understand what to do next.

Especially the quick prototyping part. If there is no external force pushing us to make results, staying at the idea or exploration stage is highly likely. Humans just don't want to exert any more xx than necessary. To get better at changing your pace, I recommend doing mini-projects as exercises (TODO apps, github.io CV page). If those feel hard to accomplish, I'd say there's one of the reasons you won't get your projects to the finish line. Just blaze it. You'll surprised when you just forget every good programming pattern and sprinkle globals with magic strings and numbers everywhere. You get things done!

And if it feels too much messy _after_ you've finished it, start from scratch. I'd say you'll spend a fraction of a time rewriting something when you know yourself all the side
