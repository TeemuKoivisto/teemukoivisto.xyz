# Introduction

I don't really enjoy writing or talking about political things in detail in general. But sometimes a thought piques me and I want to introspect it further in company or by myself. Now, a rather curious thought captured my mind.

It's generally accepted that democracy is the best system for governing. Well, the least worst at least. And it's easy to see why since as you give everyone an equal xxx it naturally demands a balance of opinions between multiple points of view to get votes from lot of people. It almost simulates swarm intelligence in sense that single aware and well-spoken individual can become suddenly the leader of the group. For a while, at least, as the new direction is taken.

However, it's no mystery that democracy has its downsides as well.

Which really xxx the main issue. The fact that every adult citizen of the country can cast an equally xxx vote is, from the apperance, good as everyone can support a representive that xxx their point of view. Yet now the banality of it becomes evident. How come a person who casts their vote to whoever loud-mouth and vitriolical agitator — there has been many throughout the years — is held at same level of accountability than the person who actually put effort and research into finding the candidate who most corresponds to their political views but also with most sensibility agenda and goals?

It seems insane, when you think about it. In a company, if a person without any knowledge of the issues would demand a right to "cast their vote" for some new hire or xxx they would be outright disregarded. Even if they did have a balanced opinion. It's just without credentials of any sorts your "vote" loses its relative strength compared to the opinions of more experienced individuals.

And now, I'm not saying that this exactly comparable to running a country. Companies are strictly hierarchial, even if their structure is flat. You have decision makers where those at the top can dictate basically any decision in the company which they of course _don't_ do as that would deteriorate the trust of the employees of their self-autonomity.

But with public offices any fool with enough raving and contagious followers can achieve almost anything. _You_ can become the top dog, the xx at the top of the pyramid. Which is rather empowering, I suppose, as a good leader surely would use this power for good. However, it seems like the properties of such leader are unknown to ordinary person or, I regret to think, irrelevant. Normally, people in companies made decisions purely to drive the good of the company. Otherwise, you're out. And in sense this happens with democratic offices as well. Do something unpopular and you're out.

Yet as these boundaries between stupid decisions and smart but comprimising are greyed out to the general population who does _not_ pay attention the whole democractic apparatus starts to wheeze. Why then we collectively have to suffer for the bad decisions of the general majority for choosing and not keeping in check xxx leaders? This is what I think has made pure democracy rather unefficient mode of governing.

Again, it's not like the others would work out well either. A dictator would surely use their power for their own selfish needs, xxx that of the population. Yet the inept xxx of the politicians in power who clearly, at least some of them, are basically just master bullshitters without any credibility or know-how outside of that narrow specialty is quite absurd.

You'd think with AI and computers so tightly woven around our society things would be different. Better. More logic-driven. Many solutions do not require a masterful deception of the public or 3rd parties, just a sound middle-ground which can be adjusted given xxx.

Well, this is where I suppose the popularity and the prestidigitation of the word is why politicians are needed. Some solutions are zero-sum — there are definitive winners and losers. How can we conclude the "morally acceptable" level of taxation for the rich? How many refugees we can take and how much money we can allocate for support of needing countries?

Clearly the most convincing argument, a bullshit xxx you could say, is necessary for both parties to present their opinion in the best light. Of which the _knowledgeable_ population would then choose to vote for one that best xxx the collective good. Hah.

Good thing is that intelligence goes hand in hand with the ability to masterfully bullshit all the strata of society. So even though the arguments would be emotionally-driven, for some issues at least, the smart politician would know the true xxx of the argument. Which concludes that democracy _needs_ deception in order to convince the rather uninformed general populace what _actually_ needs to be done instead of the emotionally-driven hobble.

What a wonderful world we live in. And so how we know which politicians do this to get the maximum votes available to them and which actually believe that stupid bullshit? I don't know but it seems the lines are getting greyer. Only remedy that I can think of is to teach people at school to be critical thinkers using logical process. But it seems the mass-media has taken that role and not for the good of all.

And once you are stuck in between these conflicting interests between greedy companies, trying to manipulate the masses for their own benefit and ludicrious populists without any actual credentials to be in deciding positions what can you do? Nothing, I suppose. For the unmotivated individual who just wants to live their own life with its own problems and tribulations. And so this is why we are still the same apes as we were in World War 2, in Middle-Ages, in Classical Antiquity.

Maybe this is just a low-point. Maybe the gradient descent moves towards a more improved and informed democracy with policies driven by both, emotions and logical analysis, as we approach Homo Superior. Perhaps. One can always dream.

## another angle

Say if we have a population of which a +50% majority are delusional and actively votes against their own and everybody else's interests except the tiniest minority's. Say this +50% exercises their democratic power and votes in a malcontent who makes the whole country worse for everyone except that tiny minority. If you belong to the saner portion of the population not voting for the demagogue, what can you do?

There are many examples from history when the masses have basically lemming'ed the whole country off a cliff by putting leaders in power whose ambitions have been poor. I won't name any, but it seems that when population starts to increasingly consist of uninformant and simple-minded individuals who somehow self-delude themselves by wishfully thinking their problems are solved by one of their own kind of people, you have uninformed and stupid politicians in charge.
