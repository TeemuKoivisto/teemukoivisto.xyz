# Introduction

Here's 3 categories I've found to exist within sofware development:

hype-driven: builds upon abstract ideas

usage-driven: bases on user requirements and telemetrics

functionality-driven: focuses on extending and polishing the current feature-set based on the assumption that better interfaces equal better user experience

Am I wrong? Any ideas for additional classes? Add a comment
