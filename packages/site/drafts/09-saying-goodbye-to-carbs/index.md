# Introduction

I, as many others, have desired to improve my health and well-being by exercising and reducing my body fat percentage. This has involved various tricks over the years mostly around my diet and training regimen. Yes yes, here I add the mandatory disclaimer that reducing your body fat isn't always necessary.

The problem and its solution in itself are quite simple: you have excess calorie intake and therefore you must decrease it until you've reached a body fat percentage you feel satisfied with. What makes it difficult though is the very complicated relationship we humans have with our bodies and our **food**.

See, we are not logical beings in most circumstances. We follow our insticts which, majority of time, seem to serve us pretty good. However, while we'd wish to eat less it might be that we find ourselves in situations where the unwanted option — unnecessary calories — is just too tempting to refuse. A late evening walk to a store, picking food on the go, social events — the list goes on. To choose simply to _eat less_ is hardly an easy task.

And as many have found out, reduction of calories is quite over-simplistic solution to weight-loss in long-term. An easier way for me and many others, has been using a restricted diet which specifically eliminates any ambiguity from eating food that's not nutrious or filling.

A huge hit and source of controversy has been the so-called **ketogenic diet**. Ketogenic diet [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet) works on the metabolic state called _ketosis_ in which your body switches its primary energy source from glucose (sugar) to ketones (fat).

> “When glycogen and blood glucose reserves are low, a metabolic shift occurs in order to save glucose for the brain which is unable to use fatty acids for energy. This shift involves increasing fatty acid oxidation and production of ketones in the liver as an alternate energy source for the brain as well as the skeletal muscles, heart, and kidney.”

> — <cite>Wikipedia</cite>

From my experience, this occurs after eating less than 20 grams of carbs per day for half a week after which it sustains itself pretty well. Even with an occasional +20 gram carb intake. It also causes a variety of other side-effects such your blood sugar stabilizing more evenly throughout the day. With carbs I've noticed big swings after I eat a heavy lunch with my brains simply unable focus well anymore. In ketosis I feel a certain sense of lightness and clarity where a slight sensation of hunger doesn't trigger such strong cravings for food.

And for dieting it's perfect! As you are already in the fat burning state the transition between burning calories from your food to burning fat from your body is much quicker. Also you lose any cravings for sugar pretty soon which leads to you staying in the calorie-deficit much better. You are perhaps socially impaired, of course, and when others are enjoying their pizzas you'll have to do with a salad and drink diet soda at the bar. But the trade-off I say is worth it.

Food-wise, the holy trinity for ketogenic food for me has become the combination of lean meat, cheese and frozen vegetables with some olive oil. Fried in the pan or cooked in the oven — doesn't matter. It tastes just as good. Add in a meat cube and you got yourself very healthy and very sating food which easily amounts to less than 20 carbs per day (100 grams of veggies is like 7 grams).

<!-- Its origins somewhat tainted by the infamous Atkins diet from the 1970s which took the consumption of fats to 11 and promoted really unhealthy options such as bacon and butter. However, nowadays people have realized that instead of the 23% fat minced pig meat you can pick chicken or fish instead. And instead of using butter for cooking, you should use oil whenever possible. -->

<!-- For me the holy trinity has become the combination of meat, cheese and frozen vegetables fried on a pan with some olive oil. It's cheap, relatively healthy and all ketogenic since the half a bag of veggies is like 10-15 grams of carbs. Add in a meat cube and some spices and I could theoretically eat it in _ad infinitum_. -->

# My recent keto-diet

I recently (January 2024) did a very intense 3-week ketogenic diet where I rapidly lost 5 kgs. This involved in addition to the cuisine I just mentioned both resistance exercises in the gym as well as 8km late evening runs when I'd feel a tinge of hunger. Yes, pretty intense. But to me it's easier when the progress is fast allowing shorter duration, even if it is more demanding. And sure, after the diet ended I quickly regained 2 kgs which I assume were the so-called "liquids".

But it did work! One key aspect of it was that as I entered ketosis being hungray didn't feel bad at all. Another interesting phenomenon I observed was the complete loss of apetite after I went for a run after 8 PM. I assume this was my body jumping from signaling "plz feed me" to "okay, we are in danger — let's use stores now" in rapid fashion.

Once the diet was in full swing one side-effect I also noticed was that I started to wake up very early without an alarm clock, all alert. I jokingly refer to the state as "Super Saiyan" mode since I believe it's some kind of genetic survival response which we probably acquired as we roamed the savannah. Rather awkward when you don't get enough sleep but still wake up — you'll be tired and out of focus the whole day.

Well anyway. After 3 weeks I reached my target weight and alas, succumbed to the carnal desires of pizza and pasta. Interestingly, I did not crave sugar in the slightest although I did eat some and thought "meh" about it. But then, as I was munging on some pesto pasta, I felt the old temptation to eat just a _little bit_ more once again. The same temptation that told me I could buy just _one_ frozen pizza for easy late lunch.

This made me realize that my state was not in equilibrium.

<!-- As I've now eaten whatever carbs I've wanted and tried not to have too big of calorie surplus, I've noticed that reaching the same feeling of fulness as I do with that fat and protein heavy food is near impossible. I don't know why but if I eat an equal calorie amount of pasta or pizza compared to a good bowl of meat and veggies, I don't feel nearly as full. Which necessarily doesn't mean I should eat more but I _can_ eat more. With the ketogenic food, I really don't feel eating more.

-> okay, so the reason is veggies have fibers?

I have hypothesis that this has something to do with the body energy conversion in that once you enter fat-burning state — ketosis — you receive stronger signals from your body of satisfied energy-need. With carbs I've noticed that this response is somewhat mollified and if you by chance over-eat you enter a completely different mode that I call "hibernation gorging". I'm not sure what kind of apocalyptical event my body thinks it wants to prepare for but it's seemingly insatiable in consuming carbs in this state which I presume mostly convert into fat. -->

# The Epiphany

I understood that I was simply deceiving myself were I to continue doing the same thing that had gotten me in this place. I had tried it before — saying no to unhealthy food. But time after time — somehow — I'd get a little soft and buy something easy and whops. I'd go over what I can consume that day and slowly but surely, get back to where I was before the diet. In order to _stay_ where I was, I'd have to change something permanently. I'd have to make ketogenic food my **standard** food.

<!-- My realization was that _having_ to diet once in a while was simply a remedy but not a cure. I am just too easily deceived by my own instincts that I can _not_ just eat freely on daily basis whatever I want. And as matter of fact, the ketogenic food that I consumed during my diet should **become** my regular food. -->

Okay, it sounds a little more dramatic than what I actually mean. So normally I'd eat (if I cook at home) some pesto pasta or meat with rice or potatoes — pretty basic stuff. However, as I'd eat these carbs I'd be also more inclined to eat more in one go or buy something less fulfilling at the store — pizza or bread or whatnot. Luckily I grew past my ice cream frenzy age last fall as I used to eat them as a snack on a regular basis after say gym. Nowadays, the only sweet stuff I consume is diet soda (but not Coke or Pepsi as I can't tolerate them anymore), which even with its faults, is healthier than say ice cream. And fruits.

But as I would eat like this — normally — inevitably a special occurence would occur (or just a lapse of judgement) where I would over-eat beyond what I could burn. And if my regular intake would be around my nominal consumption, by simple math it's easy to see that over time this surplus would eventually lead me back to where I was before I lost weight.

Therefore, it would seem that the only way to actually solve this would be to stay in perpetual slight negative surplus. Not much, but just enough to offset the occasional gatherings and cravings which are main factor I attribute my weight gain to. I still very much want to enjoy eating sweets and whatever carbs I wish in the future **but.** I have trade something away if I want to stay at my weight and do that.

<!-- Of course I'm not advertising that achieving "perfect" diet and weight is the end all of eating — I very much still want to enjoy eating sweets and whatever carbs as well. **But.** I believe I have to maintain a constant near-negative baseline consumption to counteract these occasional special events. -->

What does this mean then in practise? Well, I will become that weirdo who will bring most of the time their own food to office. I will miss out eating out with co-workers or whoever on occasion — or just end up drinking coffee together. But I honestly feel that I would be just deceiving myself if I pretended that I could control my eating with only the "don't eat too much" rule to abide by.

<!-- told myself that I will maintain my target weight if I just eat a little carbs once in a while. -->

It's somewhat bitter-sweet realization that I have to take this drastic measure to my eating in order to maintain my weight. Veggies and meat and cheese to all eternity as my standard food. Strange to think about it. Is this how people feel when they give up on meat products? Not that my decision is as strict but it seems I have to give up on something to gain something in return. Just smart enough to realize this but dumb enough to keep repeating it over and over again.

<!-- Probably a similar sensation but much less drastic than that which every coeliac, diabetic or vegan have had to go through in giving up habits in order to gain something in return. I think I am smart enough to realize what my weakness is but dumb enough to being gullible in falling for it and over-eat. Just a little bit of frozen-pizza wouldn't harm anyone... -->

<!-- I'm now realizing that this will have an impact on my daily life as I now realize its effects in full. Maybe not as drastic as those every coeliac, diabetic or vegan have had to go through but I feel I have now have to give up on my old habits in order to gain this one thing in return. Being in pro-longed low-carb diet seems to be the only choice that sticks with me. I have a mental need to _feel_ full from eating and it seems I simply can not do this with carbs without being tempted to over-eat. Just a one more bite of pizza that I could put in the fridge instead... -->

# April update

Since I first started writing this in February, I have worked my way towards a solution how I use this practise. At the moment, it seems the cycle goes now a week or two at a time of keto-food only until I have one of those special circumstances and I say "sure" to carbs. This then goes on for a while when I consume carbs, a few days or more, and my weight slightly increases as I "catch-up" on my cravings.

Then, once I have gotten it out my system I feel quite fine with returning to my basic veggies, meet and fat. At the moment my weight is slightly lower than after the 3 week intense diet, 1 kg or so. And from what my weight tracking app can tell me the projection is downwards if I keep this going.

However, I think the biggest thing I have found is that **this is doable.** I don't really find myself missing carbs in my daily food. Sure, I miss eating pizza and how easy it's to have a go-to snack from store when you are in rush. But overall I am **happy** with what I eat. I have jedi mind-tricked myself to lower my expectations on what I need on regular basis and now value the one banana I eat as much as the sugary ice cream cone from the store.

I might update this in the years to come whether things change.

# Conclusion

These has been my subjective observations in my eating habits. It may not apply to you but _if_ you feel like you're over-eating on regular basis I suggest trying out a ketogenic diet for say two weeks. You'll figure out so much about your pre-conceived notions that you _need_ carbs while in fact, eating veggies and some meat and oil is actually (at least to me) more filling. Of course, this is not medical advice and your doctor probably knows the best if your body can handle it.

And on long-term, I advice you pay close attention on the fat and protein you consume since they don't scare you of the saturated fat for no reason. I personally noticed that, when I first did keto-diet, and really wanted ice cream I made it from heavy-cream and sweetener. Which was good but having eaten it for two-weeks regularly, I started to notice my chest feeling slightly heavy. So uhh. Don't do it. And go to medical check-ups.

Dieting in itself is a practised skill just like any another and I feel I have gotten better at it the more I have done it. If you have never tried it — keto or othwerise — seriouly don't expect to achieve everything in your first attempt.

As a final side-note, I also have a genetic deficiency that causes me the infamous keto-rash from the aceton my body breaks down from fats. It's itchy (and ugly) but it's tolerable if I'm not too heavy into ketosis for extended periods of time. Which kinda puts a lid on how much keto-dieting I can even do on one go hence the rapid 3 weeks.
