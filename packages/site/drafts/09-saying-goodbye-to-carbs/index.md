# Introduction

I, as many others, have desired to improve my health and well-being by exercising and reducing my body fat percentage. This has involved various tricks over the years mostly around my diet and training regimen. Yes yes, here I add the mandatory disclaimer that reducing your body fat isn't always necessary.

The problem and its solution in itself are quite simple: you have excess calorie intake and therefore you must decrease it until you've reached a body fat percentage you feel satisfied with. What makes it difficult though is the very complicated relationship we humans have with our bodies and our **food**.

See, we are not logical beings in most circumstances. We follow our insticts which, majority of time, seem to serve us pretty good. However, while we'd wish to eat less it might be that we find ourselves in situations where the unwanted option — unnecessary calories — is just too tempting to refuse. A late evening walk to a store, picking food on the go, social events — the list goes on. To choose simply to _eat less_ is hardly an easy task.

And as many have found out, simple reduction of calories is quite over-simplistic solution to weight-loss in long-term. An easier way for me and many others, has been using a restricted diet which specifically eliminates any ambiguity from eating food that's not nutrious or filling.

A huge hit and source of controversy has been the so-called **ketogenic diet**. Ketogenic diet [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet) works on the metabolic state called _ketosis_ in which our body switches its primary energy source from glucose (sugar) to ketones (fat).

> “When glycogen and blood glucose reserves are low, a metabolic shift occurs in order to save glucose for the brain which is unable to use fatty acids for energy. This shift involves increasing fatty acid oxidation and production of ketones in the liver as an alternate energy source for the brain as well as the skeletal muscles, heart, and kidney.”

> — <cite>Wikipedia</cite>

From my experience, this occurs after eating less than 20 grams of carbs per day for half a week and it lasts even with the occasional +20 gram carb intake pretty well. Also, it causes a variety of other side-effects. I have noticed my blood sugar stabilize and remain pretty even. Compared to the big swings after I've eaten a carb heavy lunch. Also, my brains feel less foggier as there's certain sense of lightness where a slight feeling of hunger isn't that debilating sensation to my focus.

And for dieating aka. losing fat, it's perfect! You are constantly burning fat so the transition between burning fat from your food to burning fat from your body is really small. Any cravings for sugar vanish pretty soon and you might even feel disgust as you pass by them in the food aisle. You are socially impaired, of course, and can only really eat salads at the restaurants and drink diet soda at the bar. But the benefits are immense.

Food-wise, the holy trinity for ketogenic food for me has become the combination of lean meat, cheese and frozen vegetables with some olive oil. Fried and the pan or cooked in the oven — doesn't matter. It tastes just as good. Add in a meat cube and you got yourself very healthy and very sating food which easily amounts to less than 20 carbs per day (100 grams of veggies is like 7 grams).

<!-- Its origins somewhat tainted by the infamous Atkins diet from the 1970s which took the consumption of fats to 11 and promoted really unhealthy options such as bacon and butter. However, nowadays people have realized that instead of the 23% fat minced pig meat you can pick chicken or fish instead. And instead of using butter for cooking, you should use oil whenever possible. -->

<!-- For me the holy trinity has become the combination of meat, cheese and frozen vegetables fried on a pan with some olive oil. It's cheap, relatively healthy and all ketogenic since the half a bag of veggies is like 10-15 grams of carbs. Add in a meat cube and some spices and I could theoretically eat it in _ad infinitum_. -->

# My recent keto-diet

I recently (January 2024) did a very intense 3-week ketogenic diet where I rapidly lost 5 kgs. This involved in addition to the cuisine I just mentioned both resistance exercises in the gym as well as 8km late evening runs when I'd feel a tinge of hunger.

Yes, pretty intense. But that's what works for me. And sure, after the diet ended I quickly regained 2 kgs which I assume were the so-called "liquids".

However it _did_ work. And once I entered ketosis being hungry didn't feel like a such painful sensation anymore. An interesting phenomenon I observed was the complete loss of apetite after I went for run after 8 PM. I assume this was my body jumping from signaling "plz feed me" to "okay, we are in danger — let's use stores now" in rapid fashion.

Another side-effect once the diet was in full swing was that I started to wake up very early without an alarm clock all alert. I jokingly refer to the state as entering "Super Saiyan" mode since optimizing your body for the maximum productive hours per day is of course what we all should strive for, right?

Well anyway. After 3 weeks I reached my target weight and succumbed to the desires of eating pizza and pasta once more. Interestingly, I didn't feel compelled to consume sugar. And as I was munging on some pesto pasta I sensed the temptation to eat just a _little bit_ more once again. The same temptation that told I could eat just _one_ frozen pizza for easy late lunch since what's the harm?

Reflecting upon this, I understood that my state was not in equilibrium.

<!-- As I've now eaten whatever carbs I've wanted and tried not to have too big of calorie surplus, I've noticed that reaching the same feeling of fulness as I do with that fat and protein heavy food is near impossible. I don't know why but if I eat an equal calorie amount of pasta or pizza compared to a good bowl of meat and veggies, I don't feel nearly as full. Which necessarily doesn't mean I should eat more but I _can_ eat more. With the ketogenic food, I really don't feel eating more.

-> okay, so the reason is veggies have fibers?

I have hypothesis that this has something to do with the body energy conversion in that once you enter fat-burning state — ketosis — you receive stronger signals from your body of satisfied energy-need. With carbs I've noticed that this response is somewhat mollified and if you by chance over-eat you enter a completely different mode that I call "hibernation gorging". I'm not sure what kind of apocalyptical event my body thinks it wants to prepare for but it's seemingly insatiable in consuming carbs in this state which I presume mostly convert into fat. -->

# The Epiphany

My realization was that _having_ to diet once in a while was simply a remedy but not a cure. I am just too easily deceived by my own instincts that I can _not_ just eat freely on daily basis whatever I want. And as matter of fact, the ketogenic food that I consumed during my diet should **become** my regular food.

Okay okay, it sounds a little more drastic than what I actually mean. So normally I'd eat (if I cook at home) some pesto pasta or meat with rice or potatoes — pretty basic stuff. However, this carb intake is (to me) a slippery slope into having a little bit too much or then enjoying an unhealthy snack after. Here I must interject that just last fall I cut my ice cream consumption to zero which has helped immensely with staying focused on the dieting. My only real sweet that I consume is diet soda which, even with its faults, is healthier to say ice cream. And fruits.

So if I would eat like this — normally — inevitably I will have an occasional bout of over-eating due to party or some special circumstance. And _this_ would put my average intake into surplus and eventually return back to where I was a month ago.

Of course I'm not advertising that achieving "perfect" diet and weight is the end all of eating — I very much still want to enjoy eating sweets and whatever carbs as well. **But.** I believe I have to maintain a constant near-negative baseline consumption to counteract these occasional special events.

What does this mean then in practise? Well, I will become that weirdo who will bring most of the time their own food to office. I will miss out eating out with co-workers or whoever on occasion — or just end up drinking coffee together. But I really feel that I would be deceiving myself if I told myself that I will maintain my target weight if I just eat a little carbs once in a while.

It's a bit of bitter-sweet realization that my relationship to carbs has to change if I want to maintain my weight. Veggies and meat and cheese to all eternity as my standard food. Strange to think about it. Probably a similar sensation but much less drastic than that which every coeliac, diabetic or vegan have had to go through in giving up habits in order to gain something in return. I think I am smart enough to realize what my weakness is but dumb enough to being gullible in falling for it and over-eat. Just a little bit of frozen-pizza wouldn't harm anyone...

I'm now realizing that this will have an impact on my daily life as I now realize its effects in full. Maybe not as drastic as those every coeliac, diabetic or vegan have had to go through but I feel I have now have to give up on my old habits in order to gain this one thing in return. Being in pro-longed low-carb diet seems to be the only choice that sticks with me. I have a mental need to _feel_ full from eating and it seems I simply can not do this with carbs without being tempted to over-eat. Just a one more bite of pizza that I could put in the fridge instead...

# Conclusion

These has been my subjective observations in my eating habits. It may not apply to you but _if_ you feel like you're constantly over-eating I suggest trying out a ketogenic diet for say two weeks. You'll figure out so much about your pre-conceived notions that you _need_ carbs while in fact, eating veggies and some meat and oil is actually (at least to me) more filling.

Maybe balance it out with not too many bacon slices per day and a a fruit a day as well if you intend to stay in it for the long haul. Also, dieting is a practised skill which you get better at the more times you do it. Don't except you achieve everything in your first one.

As a side-note, I have a genetic deficiency in that I get the infamous keto-rash from the aceton my body breaks down from fats. It's itchy (and ugly) but I've noted being only reasonably in ketosis it's durable. I probably will have to do with only the lightest of constant ketsosis but as long as it helps to maintain my weight, I'm okay with that. Since the low-carb food already satisfies me more than enough, preventing the ketosis should the easiest job by just adding a protein pudding afterwards.
