# Introduction

So I, as many others, have desired to improve my health and well-being by exercise and reducing my body-fat percentage. This has involved various tricks over the years mostly around my diet and training regimen. Yes yes, here I add the mandatory disclaimer that reducing your body-fat isn't always necessary.

The problem and its solution in itself are quite simple: you have excess calorie intake and therefore you must decrease it until you've reached a body fat percentage you feel satisfied with. What makes it difficult though is the very complicated relationship we humans have to our food.

See, we are not logical beings in most circumstances. We follow our insticts which, majority of time, seem to serve us pretty good. However, while we'd wish to eat less it might be that we find ourselves in situation where the unwanted option — unnecessary calories — is just too tempting to refuse. A late evening walk to a store, picking food on the go, social events — the list goes on. To choose simply to just _eat less_ is hardly an easy task.

# Context

And as many have found out, simple reduction of calories is quite lackluster solution to weight-loss in long-term. An easier way for me and many others, has been using a restricted diet which specifically eliminates any ambiguity from eating food that's not nutrious or filling.

A huge hit and source of controversy has been the so-called **ketogenic diet**. Its origins somewhat tainted by the infamous Atkins diet from the 1970s which took the consumption of fats to 11 and promoted really unhealthy options such as bacon and butter. However, nowadays people have realized that instead of the 20% fat minced pig meat you can pick chicken or fish instead. And instead of using butter for cooking, you should use oil whenever possible.

For me the holy trinity has become the combination of meat, cheese and frozen vegetables fried on a pan with some olive oil. It's cheap, relatively healthy and all ketogenic since the half a bag of veggies is like 10-15 grams of carbs. Add in a meat cube and some spices and I could theoretically eat in _ad infinitum_.

# My recent diet

I recently (January 2024) did a very intense 3-week ketogenic diet where I rapidly lost 5 kgs. This involved in addition to the cuisine I just mentioned both resistance exercises at the gym as well as 8km late-evening runs when I'd feel a tinge of hunger.

Yes, pretty intense. But that's what works for me. And sure, after the diet ended I quickly regained 2 kgs which I assume were the so-called "liquids".

However, it worked. And once you entered the ketosis being hungry didn't feel like a such painful sensation anymore. An interesting phenomenon I observed was the complete loss of apetite after I ran for a 8 kilomters after 8 PM. I assume this was my body jumping from signaling "plz feed me" to "okay, we are in danger — let's use stores now" in rapid fashion. Also a side-effect of this was waking up very early without an alarm clock all alert. I jokingly refer to the state as entering "Super Saiyan" mode since optimizing your body for the maximum productive hours per day is of course everyone's highest goal and purpose, right?

Well anyway. It worked really well _but_ afterwards as I was munging a bit of pasta and feeling tempted by just buying some unnecessary frozen pizza for dinner I understood that my state was not in equilibrium.

Let me explain. As I've now eaten whatever carbs I've wanted and tried not to have too big of calorie surplus, I've noticed that reaching the same feeling of fulness as I do with that fat and protein heavy food is near impossible. I don't know why but if I eat an equal calorie amount of pasta or pizza compared to a good bowl of meat and veggies, I don't feel nearly as full. Which necessarily doesn't mean I should eat more but I _can_ eat more. With the ketogenic food, I really don't feel eating more.

I have hypothesis that this has something to do with the body energy conversion in that once you enter fat-burning state — ketosis — you receive stronger signals from your body of satisfied energy-need. With carbs I've noticed that this response is somewhat mollified and if you by chance over-eat you enter a completely different mode that I call "hibernation gorging". I'm not sure what kind of apocalyptical event my body thinks it wants to prepare for but it's seemingly insatiable in consuming carbs in this state which I presume mostly convert into fat.

# The Epiphany

The realization I now have is that if I want to really maintain a certain body-fat percentage, I can _not_ just eat freely on regular basis. In fact, the ketogenic food that I consumed during my diet should **be** my regular food.

Okay okay, it sounds a little bit more drastic than what I mean. So normally I'd eat (if I cook at home) some pasta with pesto or meat with rice or potatoes — pretty basic stuff. However, this carb intake is (to me) a slippery slope into having a little bit too much or then enjoying an unhealthy snack after. Here I must interject that just last fall I cut my ice cream consumption to zero which has helped immensely with staying focused on the dieting. My only real sweet that I consume is diet soda which, even with its faults, is superior to say ice cream. And fruits.

So if I would eat like this — normally — inevitably I will have an occasional bout of over-eating due to party or some special circumstance of sorts. And _this_ would put my average intake into surplus and eventually return back to where I was just month ago.

Of course I'm not here to proclaim that a certain body-fat % is the end all of eating — I very much still want to enjoy eating sweets and whatever carbs as well. **But.** I believe I have to maintain a constant near-negative baseline consumption to counteract these occasional special events.

What does this mean then in practise? Well, I will become that weirdo who will bring most of the time their own food to office. I will miss out eating out with co-workers or whoever on occasion — or just end up drinking coffee together. But I really feel that I would be deceiving myself I told myself that I will maintain my target weight with the regular ol pasta, rice and potatoes and whatnot.

This will have a bit of impact in my daily life as I now realize its effects in full. Maybe not as drastic as those every coeliac, diabetic or vegan have had to go through but I feel I have now have to give up on my old habits in order to gain this one thing in return. Being in pro-longed low-carb diet seems to be the only choice that sticks with me. I have a mental need to _feel_ full from eating and it seems I simply can not do this with carbs without being tempted to over-eat. Just a one more bite of pizza that I could put in the fridge instead...

# Conclusion

This has been my subjective observation of how I perceive my own eating. It may not apply to you but _if_ you feel like you're constantly over-eating I suggest trying out a ketogenic diet for say two weeks. You'll figure out some much about your pre-conceived notions that you _need_ carbs while in fact, eating veggies and some meat and oil is actually (to me) more filling.

Maybe balance it out with not too many bacon slices per day and a a fruit a day as well if you intend to stay in it for long. Also, being in diet is a practised skill which you get better at the more times you do it. Don't except you achieve everything in your first one.

As a side-note, I have a genetic deficiency in that I get the infamous keto-rash from the aceton my body breaks down from fats. It's itchy (and ugly) but I've noted being only reasonably in ketosis it's durable. I probably will have to do with only the lightest of constant ketsosis but as long as it helps to maintain my weight, I'm okay with that. Since the low-carb food already satisfies me more than enough, preventing the ketosis should the easiest job by just adding a protein pudding afterwards.
