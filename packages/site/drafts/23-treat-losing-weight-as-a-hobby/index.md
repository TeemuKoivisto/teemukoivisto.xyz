# Introduction

My main thesis is this:

you shouldn't treat weight-loss as a job or as an exam you should pass. Instead, you should treat it as a hobby. Take all the pressure and guilt from it. No more see it as a linear line from point A to B. Leave all the association with self-hate, over-reflection and bookkeeping from it, and view it through only as a curious side-adventure you find fascinating and rewarding and where your only goal is to get better at it.

Sure, this includes some caveats such as not doing it once a blue moon when you get sudden inspiration from scrolling instagram that you should, again, get your life together. That's not a hobby, that's just random spurious one-off visits. In my books, if you do something that irregularly it shouldn't count as a hobby. More like, trying things.

To me something becomes hobby only when you find it rewarding enough on its own and can be self-suistained by yourself. You don't need piano teachers to force you to play. Don't need absolute schedules every week when it is commenced. Okay, this might be dependent on the hobby as well. Some hobbies you can't just do on your own and need others, sometimes within fixed schedule.

But even then you have some inner interest that fascinates you about this things and you put non-trivial amount of effort in getting better at them. Your goal is self-improvement through incremental steps, that is accomplished by doing and learning that hobby at somewhat regular intervals.

With weight-loss, you do have some rather unique constraints of course. Once you start a weight-loss period, you have to maintain it rather extended periods of time. Can't just do a one hour slot in the evening and then be done with it.
