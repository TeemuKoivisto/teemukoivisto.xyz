# Introduction

Brain gears. Theory on levels of brain work.

This is somewhat philosophical take on brains and how we should xxx to work effectively.

In a regular combustion engine car or a bike, you have multiple gears. Normally, the 1st gear is just for taking off or in tight maneuvering, 2nd in slow driving or corners and so on. They are a necessary mechanism in order to ensure smooth transitioning between different speeds of travels â€” when you need precision and to minimize accidents, you put a lower gear and go slower. When you are already moving and see only clear road ahead, you put on a larger gear (and to follow the speed limits).

The flexibility provided by the different gears provides us different modes of traveling that are an integral part of driving cars any reasonably long distances. It would simply take too long or be too dangerous to only use very few gears. Selecting the right gear for the right leg of road is one of those intuitive stick-driving skills that you only develop with time and effort, non-withstanding the motorical skills required to change gears in tight spots.

Similarly, I have come a conclusion that our brains as well behave somewhat similarly given the inputs. For example, facing a very difficult task you really have to put effort and shut-down distractions to even begin working on it. Once you have figured out your plan of action, then putting on music or scrolling few news articles doesn't necessarily kill your momentum and you can still be productive with your work.

What's interesting, is that with time the habits become so ingrained in our brains that we don't necessarily need much high-intensnity concentration anymore to start. Often you simply fall right back into it once you decide to start the project and automatically minimize the distractions in order to get the results that you need.

Often. Not always. And this is the part that seems to trip me up the most. Putting on a really low gear after a period of high-speed cruising can be tediously frustrating and what's worst, you might unknowingly sabotage yourself by not lowering your brain "speed" to even make a successful start. I have developed a rather unfortunate habit of browsing internet with blazing fast speed in order to ingest maximum amount of interesting information or enjoyment. Which, as it happens, is detrimental for any other work on computer that require my complete concentration and focus to make progress.

Now, this isn't as bad as it sounds. For programming, I have built up rather strong muscles that help me get going even with a rougher start. Soon, if I can figure out the problem, I'll be fixing bugs and forgetting about this other source of dopamine that so indolently begs for my attention. Of course, with work you have already decided to work in the first place which already puts you in the zone where you'll bite your tongue if necessary to push through a difficult bug. However, you might really have to slow down in order to get to the bottom of it.

With projects outside work, this can be rather tricky though. In order to start something, you might need to put on the smallest gear possible _and_, if that weren't enough, commit a considerable time on getting past the rough patch without switching back-and-forth with high-speed behavior such as browsing internet.

This I think is the most evident to me with writing and music. Writing is, at times, rather tedious and time-consuming activity where the trouble starts often with the first paragraph you write. It might seem overly basic, might have grammar errors or just not be relevant for your story. Pushing past it, you gain some momentum, speed, and the ride becomes smoother although you could still be headed in wrong direction story-wise.

In order to calibrate the story and ensure I am not producing just filler sentences to make up the pages, I have to put on a gear close to crawl for me to get the engine going after a break from writing. This means minimizing my internet ingestion, especially videos since those seem to ruin my concentration to producing fictional creative content. Pen and paper seem the most optimal for generating text that actually feels like something as I can think through every word as write them down, unlike with computers where the words appear so fast my brains might not have time to process them.

Moreover, the ramp-up involved getting over the rough terrain involved in beginning writing or learning say piano, needs at least a couple days with diligent effort that my lizard brain does not always seem to understand well enough to xxx them.

But the fact is, once I really slow down and don't let my thoughts trash about by the constant tumbling of internet, there is a rather comfortable place where I recognize the effects it has and even reel back from watching things as I start to feel the tension building up in my brain. Quicker and quicker does not always work and things like writing or creating music needs a pace different than of the electronic devices. Like climbing stars with a broken foot, you become conscious of your movement and instead of rushing through it, you relax and take your time without worrying how long it will take. You just keep moving and don't try to watch a Youtube video as you do it.
