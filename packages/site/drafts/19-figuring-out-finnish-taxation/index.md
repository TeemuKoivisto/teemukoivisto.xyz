# Introduction

because i wanted to make this PoC to show that paying taxes shouldn't be that complicated and then I had to figure out how the hell they are even payed

a good exercise of I think citizen rights to understand where are your money going to

i thought i had an okay model but then i realized I had completely forgot deduction and _municipality tax_. What a stupid tax. Not because municipalities are stupidd but because it's calculated in such contrived and insane way

I'm paraphrasing here veronmaksajat.fi and here's the calculation is made as of 2024

So uhhh... How much do I get with say 50k income? The whole thing reeks of politicians adjusting the knobs, with the help of tax officials of course, without any consideration of the intelligibility of the system.

Close second, income deductions. Again paraphrasin veronmaksajat.fi

yyy

At this point, you just gotta laugh at the brains of whoever came up with this. Probably in some tedious meeting room with soft-voiced byroucreatus just spewing jargon while the politicians are nodding and agreeing to some half-assed comprimise such as this.

in the end went to the tax office directly and asked people to help me
