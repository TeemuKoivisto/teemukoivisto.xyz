              Hi there stranger!
            </h1>
            <p>Stay a while, and listen üë¥üèª...</p>
            <p>
              Once upon a time, the universe was born and stars exploded generating billions of
              atoms of heavy metals that somehow ended up on a planet named Earth. These metals
              then, along with complex carbon molecules, ended up composing this biological being,
              the most advanced creature to ever walk on the planet. That then ended up sitting in a
              weird, sloped position behind a computer writing long days and evenings inanimate
              abstract hieroglyphs named programming code. That produced this delirious website
              filled with mundane knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hmm, now that I have lowered the expectations I can at least share a little bit of
              myself here. I have always thought, since the times immemorial when I just a young
              boy, that personal websites should include a personal touch to them. You know, those
              quirky 90's websites which were all bizarre but also very unique and homely. That are
              a far-cry from the SEO-optimized "look at me and my stupid pictures" blogs that seem
              to infest the modern era websites. I'm not saying that this necessarily a _bad_ thing.
              But it does seem to me that the internet has lost valuable part of it - a human
              perspective. That has been replaced by the calculated machinations of glory-seeking
              wannabes wanting to make money and become famous.
            </p>
            <p>
              Heh heh. What a nice start huh? Bash down everyone else and then make yourself the
              same kind of content. Good for me, huh? I told you I was delirious.
            </p>
            <p>
              But anyway, I should probably xx my own words and tell something interesting about me
              and what the hell am I even doing here.
