      Hi there stranger!
    </h1>
    <p>Stay a while, and listen üë¥üèª...</p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, the universe was born and stars exploded generating trillions and trillions
      of atoms of heavy metals that somehow ended up on a planet named Earth. These metals then,
      along with complex carbon molecules, after billions of years composed this biological being,
      the most advanced creature to ever walk on the planet. That then ended up sitting in a weird,
      sloped position behind a computer screen writing long days and evenings inanimate abstract
      hieroglyphs named programming code. That produced this delirious website filled with mundane
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I been born couple hundreds years prior to this day and age though, I'd probably be just a
      rambling maniac in a tavern shouting over other drunken noise about how to seed your fields
      with less manure. Given the scale of the universe, I'd say it's not that bad. Nice, even.

      Anyway so krrhm. This blog then. Well. As part of my epic quest through the perils of life
      I've come to a point where tending my own plot of virtual land in the vastness of internets
      seemed appealing. When I think of a blog or a homesite, I'm taken back to the time when I was
      a child and saw the first weird looking pages of crazy blinking text and headers with some
      very opionated nutcase sharing their vision of society. Sure, the 90's web wasn't necessarily
      the most intuitive or pleasing in UX but there was something real and honest about it too.
      Nowadays, the most important thing of a home site is to boost your job prospects and give your
      name some stupid SEO visibility and internet-fame. But I ask you, what's the point? Does it
      really enhance your life to be the second page result in tutorials how to setup a React app
      with TypeScript?
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
    So as part of my epic quest through the perils of life I've crafted this tedious
    patch of virtual land in the open sea of internet. To me, personal home pages should
    be created with humor and joy and a little bit of madness as I recall them from the days of
    yonder. Sure, 90's websites may not tick all the boxes of modern UX design but god
    damn they had something real and honest about them. Nowadays it seems the most
    important job of your home site is to promote SEO-optimized low-level programming
    tutorials to boost your visibility and provide you the x of what such fame brings.
    Such a foolish quest, where's the humanity? Where's the person behind the screen?
    Commodized and calculated we have come, futilely optimizing our lives to be a second
    page result in how to setup a React app with TypeScript.

      Okay, I'll get off my soapbox and stop ranting. The degrees of insanity you can plough through
      when crafting your blog can some times trip you. A fun fact, this is the
      <strong>third</strong>
      iteration of this site. Third. What, why - you ask. And I whisper in your ear: "because I can".
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I had my reasons for sure. How annoying Gatsby can be with its bloated configs and how
      Next.js, cool and fast yet still so soulless, was just another headache to work on. If I find
      my blog to be a chore to build, why spend my precious time on it? Also, I think I just got
      distracted - that might have been it too ü§î. No one knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time though, things will be different. Because really there isn't really much options
      left to build your blog with hah hah. What I used this time wasn't Svelte although in
      hindsight I probably would have enjoyed that a lot more than using just plain HTML, CSS and
      JS. Okay, I render the meta tags with React but that's about it. And since I went off to the
      crazy end I did use WebComponents to wrap the components with which wasn't necessarily a good
      idea but well, if you don't do it for your blog then for what? In the end, my madness
      prevailed and you reading this blog standing is a proof that sometimes you can get to the
      finish line in software engineering... Har har.
    </p>
    <p>In my original iteration I did write a short overview of my life</p>

    <p>
      Right right, I am getting off-tangent here. Bout of insanity, happens a lot when writing your
      blog. Did you know this is the <strong>third</strong> iteration of this site with virtually
      the same UI? Wait what why - you ask. And I whisper in your ear: "because I can". And because
      Gatsby, obviously, is way too bloated and Next.js just annoys me with its overly strict
      conventions. Boohoo, css files are not referenced in app.tsx or don't have .module.css suffix.
      Who cares. Also, I've found out the hard way how crucial low-maintenance is for a site
      supposed to last for decades. Now that I've written this using a custom Vite renderer plugin
      (yes, I could have probably invented a cure for cancer if I had spent the time on that
      instead) I think I've finally reached apotheosis of my blog. Well, a few things could be
      enhanced, sure, but
      <i>maybe</i> this time I'll focus on other things instead. Sometimes the goal
      <i>is</i> more important than the journey...
    </p>
    <p>So *cough cough* <i>what I am saying</i> is,</p>
